<h1>PREFACE</h1>
<p>The far-away little island of Tahiti is the gem
of the South Pacific Ocean. If any place in this
world deserves to be called a paradise, Tahiti
can make this claim. This charming spot in the
wide expanse of the peaceful ocean has
attractions which we look for in vain anywhere else.
From a distance, the grandeur of its frowning
cliffs rivets the eye, and, in coming nearer, its
tropic beauty charms the visitor and imprints
upon his memory pictures single and panoramic
that neither distance nor time can efface. The
scenic beauty of this island is unsurpassed. The
calming air, redolent with the perfume of fragrant
flowers of exquisite beauty, on the seashore, in
the valleys and on the precipitous mountain
sides; the luxuriant vegetation; the forest
fruit-gardens and the sweet music of the surf remind
one of the original habitation of man. The
natives, a childlike people, friendly, courteous
and hospitable, are the happiest people on earth,
free from care and worries which in other less
favored parts of the world make life a drudgery.</p>
<p>Tahiti is the only place in the world where
the people are not obliged to work. The forests
furnish bread and fruit and the sea teems with
fish. The climate is so mild that the wearing of
clothing is rather a matter of choice than of
necessity, and the bamboo huts that can be made
with little or no expense in half a day with
the willing help of the neighbors, meet all the
requirements of a home. The stranger will find
here throughout the year a climate and
surroundings admirably adapted to calm his nervous
system and procure repose and sleep.</p>
<p>In writing this little book I have made free use
of the &quot;Memoirs of Arrii Taimai E., Marama
of Eimeo, Terii rere of Tooarai, Terii nui of
Tahiti, Tauraatua I Amo&quot; (Paris, 1901). The
authoress was the mother of Tati, one of the
most influential present chiefs of Tahiti, and, as
her several titles show, she was of noble birth.
She was an eye-witness of many of the most
stirring political events in the history of the
island. Only fifty copies of this book were
printed and only three remained in possession
of her son. He was kind enough to give me
one of them, which, after making liberal use
of it, I presented to the library of the University
of Chicago, through its late lamented president,
Dr. W. R. Harper. I also acknowledge my
indebtedness to the works of Captain Cook, &quot;A
Voyage to the Pacific&quot; (London, 1784), and to
the book of Baron Ferd. von Mueller, &quot;Select
Extra-tropical Plants&quot; (Melbourne, 1885).</p>
<p>N. Senn.</p>
<p>Chicago, 1906.</p>

<h1>TAHITI THE ISLAND PARADISE</h1>
<p>When the Almighty Architect of the universe
created the earth we inhabit, He manifested His
wisdom, goodness and foresight in adapting, in
a most admirable manner, the soil, climate, and
animal and vegetable life for the habitation of
man, the supreme work of creation. By the
gradual and progressive geographical
distribution of man over the surface of the earth, he
has become habituated to diverse climates and
environments, and has found conditions most
congenial to his comfort and the immediate
necessities of life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In cold, laborious climes, the wintry North</p>
<p>Brings her undaunted, hardy warriors forth,</p>
<p>In body and in mind untaught to yield,</p>
<p>Stubborn of soul, and steady in the field;</p>
<p>While Asia's softer climate, form'd to please.</p>
<p>Dissolves her sons in indolence and ease.</p>
<p>LUCANUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It required centuries for the Esquimau to
become acclimated to the inhospitable polar regions,
and make them his favorite abode; the people
who drifted toward the equator gradually
became inured to the climate of the tropics and
accustomed to the manner of living in countries
where the perennial heat paralyzes the physical
and mental energies, and undermines the health
of strangers coming from a more temperate
climate. Nature has made ample provision for
man in all habitable parts of the earth. The
regions of ice and snow are inhabited by
fur-bearing animals, and, at certain seasons of the
year, are frequented by a large variety of aquatic
birds in great abundance, which supply the natives
with food and clothing, while in the tropics, man
has little or no need of fuel and clothing, and,
with very little exertion, he can subsist on the
fruits of the forests, and on the food so liberally
supplied by the sea.</p>
<p>The intensity of the struggle for life increases
with the distance north and south from the
temperate zones, where climatic conditions
necessitate active exercise and where the necessities of
life can only be obtained by the hardest kind of
labor. The climate of the tropics, on the other
hand, is very generous to man. The forests are
rich in fruit yielding trees which Nature plants,
which receive little or no care, yet which bear
fruit throughout the year. Wherever the
cocoa-palm grows in abundance, there can be no famine,
because this tree yields a rich harvest of nutritious
fruit from one end of the year to the other
without fail, as it is never affected to any considerable
extent by drouth and other conditions which so
often bring failure to the orchards in more
temperate climates. The continuous summer and the
wonderful fertility of the soil in tropic and
subtropic countries reward richly the labor of the
husbandman by two and sometimes three
harvests a year, as nature's forces require no rest, no
slumber there.</p>
<p>Life in a changeable, severe climate is full of
hardships; in the tropics, of ease and leisure. The
nearer we come to the tropics, the closer we
approach the conditions of primitive man. The
necessities of life increase as we recede on either
side of the equatorial line. The dreamy, easy,
care-free life in the tropics is in strong contrast
with the severe and arduous struggles for
existence in countries less favored by the resources
of nature.</p>
<p>Among the trees in the Garden of Eden, the
palm tree was undoubtedly the most beautiful,
and it remains to-day the queen of the forests of
the seacoast in the tropics. The palm-clad isles
of the South Sea bear a closer resemblance to the
description of the Garden of Eden than any other
of the many parts of the world that I have ever
seen; and of these, Tahiti is a real paradise on
earth. There is no country nor other isle where
Nature has been so liberal in the distribution of
her gifts. No other island can compare in natural
beauty with Tahiti, the gem of the South Pacific
Ocean. It is the island where life is free of care.
It is the island where the natives are fed, clothed
and housed by nature. It is the island where man
is born, eats his daily bread without being forced
to labor, sleeps and dreams away his life free from
worry, and enjoys the foretaste of the eternal
paradise before he dies. It is the island which
must have been born</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the morning of the world,</p>
<p>When earth was nigher heaven than now.</p>
<p>BROWNING.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the island of which the poet must have
been musing when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amid an isle around whose rocky shore</p>
<p>The forests murmur and the surges roar,</p>
<p>A goddess guards in her enchanted dome.</p>
<p>POPE.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-island-of-tahiti">
<h1>THE ISLAND OF TAHITI</h1>
<p>About three thousand six hundred miles south
by southwest from San Francisco are the Society
Islands, a small archipelago in the South Pacific
Ocean, in latitude 16 to 18 degrees south,
longitude 148 to 155 degrees west. Captain Cook
named this group in honor of the Royal Society
of London. The largest two of these islands,
Tahiti and Moorea, are of volcanic origin,
mountainous and heavily timbered; the remaining
islands are small, low, of coral origin, and are
called atolls. In approaching the archipelago
from San Francisco, a few of these palm-fringed
atoll islands come first into view, forming a
pleasing foreground to the rugged mountains of
Tahiti and its smaller neighbor, Moorea, which
are sighted almost at the same time. After a
voyage over the desert ocean of thirteen days
(all this time out of sight of land), to gaze on
the most beautiful islands of this group is a
source of exquisite pleasure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sea-girt isles,</p>
<p>That like to rich and various gems, inlay</p>
<p>The unadorned bosom of the deep.</p>
<p>MILTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The South Pacific Ocean is the natural home
of the coral polyps, which are great
island-builders, using the volcanic material as a
foundation for the coral superstructure. As these
minute builders can live only in shallow water,
they use submerged mountain peaks for their
foundations, converting them into low atolls, and
building reefs around the base of the high
volcanic islands. Most of the Society Islands are
of coral formation perched upon submerged
mountain summits. The island of Tahiti is small,
of little commercial interest, and hence it is
comparatively unknown to the masses of the people.
Very few who left the schoolroom twenty-five
years ago would be able to locate it without
consulting a geography, and many have even
forgotten the name. The children fresh from school
recall it in connection with the difficulty they
encountered in finding the little dot in the great,
trackless South Pacific Ocean, surrounded by a
group of still smaller specks, representing the
remainder of the little archipelago to which it
belongs.</p>
<p>Tahiti is nearly four thousand miles distant
from San Francisco, in a southwesterly direction,
below the equator, in latitude 17, hence in a
similar latitude to that of the Hawaiian Islands,
which are situated about the same distance north
of the equator.</p>

<p class="caption">LIGHTHOUSE AND COOK MONUMENT AT HAAPAPE</p>
</div>
<p>I had heard much of the natural beauty of
this far-off island and its interesting inhabitants,
and decided to spend my midwinter vacation in
1904 in paying it a visit. Formerly the passage
from San Francisco had to be made by a
schooner, and required several months. For
the last four years the island has been made
readily accessible by a regular steamer service.
The staunch steamer, <em>Mariposa</em>, of the Oceanic
Steamship Company of San Francisco, sails from
that port every thirty-six days, makes the trip in
twelve or thirteen days, and remains at Papeete,
the capital of the island, four days, which give
the visitor ample time to visit the most interesting
points and make the desired observations. The
track of the steamer is over that part of the
Pacific Ocean which is comparatively free from
violent storms, between the storm centers east
and west from it. The prevailing trade-winds
cool off the tropical heat in the vicinity of the
equator, rendering the voyage at all seasons of
the year a pleasant one. The steamer has a
tonnage of three thousand tons, the service is
excellent, and the table all that could be desired. I
know of no better way to spend a short
mid-winter vacation than a trip to Tahiti, the island
paradise, the most interesting and beautiful of all
islands.</p>
<p>January and February are the months when
the fruit is most abundant, and the climate most
agreeable. The twenty-five days of voyage on
the ocean, the few days on shore occupied by a
study of its natives, their customs, manner of
living, by visits to the various points of historic
interest, and by the greatest of all genuine
pleasures, the contemplation of nature's choicest
exhibitions in the tropics, are all admirably adapted to
procure physical rest and pleasure, and pleasing
as well as profitable mental occupation. A trip to
Tahiti will prove of particular benefit to those
who are in need of mental rest. The absence of
anything like severe storms on this trip should be
a special inducement, for those who are subject
to seasickness, to travel there.</p>
<p>The steamer is well adapted for service in the
tropics, the cabins are roomy and comfortable.
Capt. J. Rennie is one of the most experienced
commanders of the fleet, a good disciplinarian
and devoted to the safety and comfort of his
passengers. While the steamer can accommodate
seventy cabin passengers, the number seldom
exceeds twenty-five. The tourist therefore
escapes crowding and noise, so trying to the
nerves, and so common on the transatlantic
steamers and other more frequented ocean routes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ocean-voyage">
<h1>OCEAN VOYAGE</h1>
<p>The steamer <em>Mariposa</em> leaves the San Francisco
wharf at eleven o'clock a. m.,—an excellent time
for the passengers to enjoy the beauties of the
bay and the Golden Gate, to see the rugged coast
of California gradually disappear in the distance
during the course of the afternoon, and to prepare
himself for the first night's sleep in the cradle
of the deep. The second day out, and until the
mountains of Tahiti come in sight, the traveler
will see nothing but the floating tavern in which
he lives, its inmates, the inky blue ocean, the sky,
clouds, and, occasionally, sea-gulls, and isolated
schools of flying fish. The steamer's track is
over an unfrequented part of the ocean. The
passenger looks in vain for a mast or
white-winged sails, or puffs of smoke in the distance,
sights so often seen on more frequented ocean
highways. The steamer crosses an ocean desert
little known, but out of reach of the violent
storms, so frequent near the coasts, on both sides
free from reefs and rocks, as this part of the
ocean is of unusual depth, amounting in many
places to three miles. Stranding of the vessel,
or collision with others, the greatest dangers
incident to sea travel, are therefore reduced to a
minimum on this route. Although this course is
an unusually lonely one, the interested observer
will find much to see and enjoy. The vast
expanse of the ocean impresses the traveler from
day to day and grows upon him as the distance
from the coast increases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Illimitable ocean! without bound,</p>
<p>Without dimensions, where length, breadth, and height,</p>
<p>And time, and place, are lost</p>
<p>MILTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The boundless ocean desert, mirror-like when
at rest, clothed by gentle ripples and ceaseless
wavelets when fanned by the trade-winds, is a
picture of peace and contentment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The winds with wonder whist,</p>
<p>Smoothly the waters kiss'd,</p>
<p>Whispering new joys to the mild ocean.</p>
<p>MILTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even here in the most peaceful part of the
Pacific, when angered by the fury of a heavy
squall, a diminutive storm agitates the waters into
foam-crested waves, which, for a short time at
least, impart to the ship an intoxicated gait. The
effect of sun, moon and starlight on the smooth,
undulating, heaving, billowing, tossing,
storm-beaten surface of the ocean, is marvelous. When
all is quiet, and the passenger is only conscious of
the vibratory movements imparted to the ship by
the ceaseless action of the faithful screw, and the
lights of heaven are veiled by a curtain of dark
clouds, the beautiful blue gives way to a sombre
black. When the tropic sun shines with all his
force, the color of the water fairly vies with the
deep blue of the sky, and the nearer we approach
our destination, the tints of blue grow deeper and
deeper, until at last they are of perfect indigo.</p>

<p class="caption">KING POMARE V.</p>
</div>
<p>The moon and starlight have a magic effect on
the surface of the water. The long evenings give
the passengers the exquisite pleasure of watching
the journey of the moon across the starlit
heavenly dome, growing, night after night, from a mere
sickle to her full majestic size, and of observing
the effects of the gradually increasing intensity of
the light issuing from the welcome visitor of the
night, on the glassy mirror of water beneath.
The star-bedecked pale dome of the tropic sky
is, in itself, a picture that rivets the attention of
the traveler who loves and studies the book of
nature. The short twilight over, &quot;these blessed
candles of the night&quot; (Shakespeare) are lighted,
and send their feeble light down upon the bosom
of the ocean.</p>
<p>If the sky is clear, the illuminating power of
the moon at its best, and the ocean calm, its
surface is transformed into a boundless sheet of
silver. This magic effect of moonlight on the
surface of the sleeping ocean is magnified by
passing fleecy, or dark, storm-threatening clouds.
The fleeting, fleecy clouds often veil, only in part,
the lovely, full face of the moon, and through
fissures, the rays of light issue, and, falling upon
the water, are reflected in the form of silvery
patches or pathways, corresponding in size and
outline with the temporary window in the passing
cloud. It is when the moon is about to be hidden
behind a dark, impenetrable veil that the
spectator may expect to see the most wonderful
display of pictures above and around him. As the
cloud approaches the moon, the blue background
deepens in color and brilliancy and when its dark
margin touches the rim of the moon it is changed
into a fringe of gold or silver; with the
disappearance of the moon behind the cloud the fringe of
the latter is rudely torn away, the water beneath
is robbed of its carpet of silver, and the
captivated observer is made aware that the darkness
of night is upon him. But the gloom is of short
duration. A break in the cloud serves as a
window through which the moon peeps down,
with a most bewitching grace, upon the dark
surface beneath. The prelude to this exhibition
appears on the side of the temporary frame, in
the form of a silver lining which broadens with
the moving cloud; now the rim of the moon
comes into view; slowly, the veil is completely
thrown aside, and Luna's calm, pale, smiling, full
face makes its appearance, enclosed in a dark
frame with silver margins, while, more than
likely, she will be attended by a few brilliant
stars, thus completing the charms and beauty
of the picture suspended from the heavenly
dome. All genuine pleasures of this world are
of short duration; so with this nocturnal picture
painted on the clouds and water. The silver rim
on one side of the frame of clouds disappears, the
dark margin increases in width, the moon is
obscured, and only a few flickering stars remain
fixed in the picture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surely there is something in the unruffled calm of
nature that overcomes our little anxieties and doubts:
the sight of the deep blue sky, and the clustering stars
above, seem to impart a quiet to the mind.</p>
<p>JONATHAN EDWARDS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In midocean is the place to view at greatest
advantage the gorgeous sunrise and sunset of the
tropics. To see the sun disappear in the distance,
where the dome of the sky seems to rest on the
bosom of the ocean, is a scene which no pen can
describe, and which no artist's brush has ever
reproduced in any degree comparable with the
grand reality. The canvas of the sky behind the
setting glowing orb, and the passing clouds in
front, above, and beneath it, are painted
successively by the invisible brush in the unseen hands
of the departing artist in colors and shades of
colors that may well laugh to scorn any and all
attempts at description or reproduction. The
gilded horizon serves as a fitting background for
the retreating monarch of the day, and the slowly
moving canvas of clouds transmits his last
messages in all the hues of red, crimson, pink, and
yellow. To observe this immense panorama
stretched from north to south, and projected
toward the east, resting on the silvery surface of
the rippling ocean, with the ever-varying colors
of the slowly moving clouds, as seen evening
after evening on the Tahitian trip, leaves
impressions which time can not erase from memory.</p>
<p>Night on board the <em>Mariposa</em> has additional
attractions for the passengers who appreciate the
wonders and beauties of nature. When the night
is dark, they find a place in the stern of the ship,
lean against the taffrail, and watch the water
agitated into a diminutive storm by the powerful
screw. There one beholds a sight sufficiently
attractive and interesting to keep him spellbound
for an hour or more. The indolent,
phosphorescent sea-amoeba has been roused into action by
the merciless revolutions of the motor of the ship,
and emits its diamond sparks of phosphorescent
light. Thousands of these little beings discharge
their magic light in the white veil of foam which
adorns the crests of the storm-beaten surface, in
the form of a narrow track as far as the eye can
reach in the darkness of the night. The flashes
of light thrown off by these minute, to the naked
eye invisible, inhabitants of the sea, when angered
by the rude action of the screw, appear and
disappear in the twinkling of an eye. When these
tiny, light-producing animals are numerous, as
is the case in the equatorial region, the
snow-white veil of foam is richly decorated with
diamond sparks which, when they coalesce, form
flames of fire in the track of the vessel.</p>

</div>
<p>The ocean voyage has occasionally still another
surprise in store for the traveler when he reaches
the South Pacific. A squall is a tempest on a
small scale. We see in the distance a dark cloud
of immense size which seems to ride slowly over
the surface of the smooth sea. The gentle breeze
gives way to a strong wind, the surface of the
water becomes ruffled with whitecaps, the
darkness increases, and at irregular intervals the
threatening, angry cloud is lighted up by chains
of lightning thrown in all possible directions;
these flashes are followed by peals of thunder, and
by prolonged rumbling, which becomes feebler
and feebler, and finally dies away far out on the
surface of the ocean. The steamer penetrates the
storm area. Darkness prevails. Gigantic drops
of rain strike the deck and patter upon the canvas
awning, the harbingers of a drenching rain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now the thick'ned sky</p>
<p>Like a dark ceiling stood; down rush'd the rain impetuous.</p>
<p>MILTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cloud and darkness are left behind, and a
clear sky and smooth sea ahead greet the
passengers. Did you ever see a rainbow at midnight?
Such an unusual nocturnal spectral phenomenon
greeted us in midocean: the full moon in the east,
the delicate rainbow in its infinite colors painted
on the clouds in the west. Our captain, who had
lived on the tropic sea for a quarter of a
century, had never seen the like before. It was
reserved for us to see a rainbow painted by the
moon. With such pleasant diversions, by day
and by night, we soon forget the ocean desert,
and yet on the last day of the voyage we welcome
the sight of land.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be of good cheer, I see land.</p>
<p>DIOGENES.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vastness of the ocean and the smallness of
Tahiti are in strange contrast. How the mariner,
in setting the compass on leaving the harbor of
San Francisco, can so unerringly find this little
speck in the ocean nearly four thousand miles
away, is an accomplishment which no one, not
versed in the science of navigation can fully
comprehend. We sighted Tahiti during the early
part of the forenoon. The peaks of the two
highest mountains in Tahiti, Oroheua and Aorii,
seven to eight thousand feet in height, projected
spectre-like from the surface of the ocean. These
peaks appeared as bare, sharp, conical points in the
clear sky above a mantle of clouds which
enveloped the balance of the island. This misty
draping of the two highest mountains takes place
almost every day, as the clouds are attracted by
the constant moisture of the soil, due to the
dense forests and luxuriant tropical vegetation.</p>
<p>The next sight of land brought into view the
rugged mountains of Moorea and a group of
small atoll islands. Moorea is in plain view from
Papeete, and is the second largest of the Society
Islands. Before we look at Tahiti at close range,
let us examine the group of atoll islands which
the steamer passes close enough to give us a
good idea of their formation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-atoll-islands">
<h1>THE ATOLL ISLANDS</h1>
<p>The atoll islands, so numerous in the South
Seas, have a uniform conformation, and are of
coral, deposited upon submerged summits of
mountains of volcanic origin. The floor of the
Pacific, like many other parts of the earth's
surface, is undergoing constant changes,
increasing or diminishing its level. Here and there, at
certain intervals, volcanic eruptions have created
mountains, which, in Hawaii, rise to nearly
fourteen thousand and, in Tahiti, to over seven
thousand feet. Around each of these innumerable
islands and islets in the great Pacific Ocean the
coral polyps have a fringing reef of rock. As
these minute creatures can live only at a depth
of twenty to thirty fathoms, and die as soon as
exposed to the air, their life-work is confined to
the coast of volcanic islands. Whenever, as it
often happened, the island upon which they had
congregated was slowly sinking, they would
elevate their wall to save themselves from death
in deep water. It is evident that if this process
continued long enough, the land would entirely
disappear and leave a submerged circular wall of
coral just below the level of the low tide. The
effects of the waves in breaking off the coral
formation, large and small, in elevating them,
would, in course of time, produce a ring of
sandy beach, rising above the sea surrounding
the central basin, filled with salt water entering
through one or many open channels. Upon the
beach, cocoanuts, washed ashore, would find a
favorable soil for germination, and, ere long,
stately palms would fringe the rim of the enclosed
lagoon. Every atoll island has a peripheral
fringe of cocoa-palms and a central lagoon which
communicates with the ocean by one or more
channels. Such an island is an atoll, the final
stage in the disappearance of a volcanic islet
from the surface of the sea. Such islands are
numerous in the Society Islands, and the
Paumotuan Archipelago consists exclusively of
such atoll islands.</p>

<p class="caption">VIEW OF MOOREA</p>
</div>
<p>It is interesting to know how these minute
coral polyps manage their work of island-building,
or, rather, island-preservation. Coral
formation is a calcareous secretion or deposit of many
kinds of zoöphytes of the class Anthozoa, which
assumes infinite and often beautiful forms,
according to the different laws which govern the
manner of germination of the polyps of various
species. The coral-producing zoöphytes are
compound animals, which multiply in the very
swiftest manner, by germination or budding,
young polyp buds springing from the original
polyp, sometimes indifferently from any part of
its surface, sometimes only from its upper
circumference or from its base, and not separating
from it, but remaining in the same spot when
the original parent or polyp is dead, and
producing buds in their turn. The reproductive
capacity of these polyps is marvelous and explains the
greatness of their work in building up whole
islands and the countless submerged reefs so
much dreaded by the mariners of the South Seas.
The calcareous deposition begins when the
zoöphytes are still simple polyps, owing their
existence to oviparous reproduction, adhering to a
rock or other substance, to which the calcareous
material becomes attached, and on which the
coral is built up, the hard deposits of past
generations forming the base to which those of the
progeny are attracted. The coral formation takes
place with astonishing rapidity; under favorable
circumstances, masses of coral have been found
to increase in height several feet in a few months,
and a channel cut in a reef surrounding a coral
island, to permit the passage of a schooner, has
been blocked with coral in ten years. Coral
formations have been found immediately attached
to the land, whilst in many other cases the reef
surrounds the island, the intervening space, of
irregular, but nowhere of great width, forming a
lagoon or channel of deep water, protected by
the reef from wind and waves. According to
Darwin, this kind of reef is formed from a reef
of the former merely fringing kind, by the
gradual subsidence of the rocky basis, carrying
down the fringe of coral to a greater depth;
whilst the greatest activity of life is displayed by
polyps of the kind most productive of large
masses of coral in the outer parts which are
most exposed to the waves. In this manner he
also accounts for the formation of true coral
islands, or atolls, which consist merely of a
narrow reef of coral surrounding a central
lagoon, and very often of a reef, perhaps half a
mile in breadth, clothed with luxuriant
vegetation and the never-absent cocoa-palms,
bordered by a narrow beach of snowy whiteness, and
forming an arc, the convexity of which is toward
the prevailing wind, whilst a straight line of reef
not generally rising above the reach of the tide,
forms the chord of the arc. The reef is
generally intersected by a narrow channel into the
enclosed lagoon, the waters of which are still and
beautifully transparent, teeming with the greatest
variety of fish. Its surface is enlivened by
water-fowl, and the depth of water close to the
precipitous sides of the reef is almost always very
great. The channels are kept open by the flux
and reflux of the tide, the current and waves of
which are often so swift and high as to become
a menace to schooners attempting entrance into
the lagoon. On the beach, soil most conducive
to the growth of cocoanut-palms is formed by
accumulation of sand, shells, fragments of coral,
seaweeds, decayed leaves, etc. The giant
cocoanuts planted in this soil either by the hand of man
or by the waves washing them ashore, germinate
quickly, and in a few years the narrow circular
strip of land enclosing the lagoon is fringed with
colonnades of tall fruit-bearing palms. These
islands rise nowhere more than a few feet above
the level of the sea. Sometimes the upheaval of
coral formation by volcanic action results in the
making of a real island, in which event the lagoon
disappears. Islands with such an origin
sometimes rise to a height of five hundred feet and
often exhibit precipitous cliffs and contain
extensive caves. I had read a description of the
Paumotu atoll islands by Stevenson, and
consequently I was much interested in the little group
of atolls we passed before coming into full view
of Tahiti. As these islands, like all true atolls,
are only a few feet above the level of the sea,
they can not be seen from the sea at anything like
a great distance. When they were pointed out
to us by an officer of the steamer, we could see
no land; they appeared like oases in the desert,
green patches in the ocean, due to the
cocoapalms which guarded their shores. As we came
nearer, we could make out the rim of land and
the snow-white coral beach. The smallest of
these atoll islands are not inhabited, but regular
visits are made to them in a small schooner or
native double canoe to harvest and bring to
market the never-failing crops of cocoanuts.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-landing-at-papeete">
<h1>THE LANDING AT PAPEETE</h1>
<p>As we left the atolls behind us and neared
Tahiti, we could see more clearly the outlines of
the rugged island, disrobed, by this time, of its
vestments of clouds. From a distance, the carpet
of green which extends from its base to near the
summit of the highest peaks is varied here and
there by patches of red volcanic earth, thus
adding to the picturesqueness of the scene. What at
first appears as a greensward on the shore, on
nearer view discloses itself as a broad fringe of
cocoa-palms, extending from the edge of the
ocean to the foot of the mountains, and from
there well up on their slopes, where they are lost
in the primeval forest. Above the tree-line, low
shrubs and hardy grasses compose the verdure
up to the bare, brown mountain-peaks. The
largest trees are seen in the mountains' deep
ravines, which are cut out of the side of the
heights by gushing of cold, clear waters, which
drain the very heart of the mountains, bounding
and leaping over boulders and rapids in their race
to a resting-place in the near-by calm waters of
the lagoon. As we came nearer to the island we
were able to make out the white lighthouse
on Point Venus, seven miles from Papeete. Here,
Captain Cook, during one of his visits to the
island, was stationed for a considerable length of
time for the purpose of observing the transit of
Venus; hence the name of the point.</p>
<p>Near the harbor, a native pilot came on board,
and, by careful maneuvering, safely guided the
ship through the very narrow channel in the reef
into the harbor, with the tricolor flying from the
top mast. From the harbor, the little city of
Papeete and the island present an inspiring view.
A charming islet on the left as we enter the
harbor, looks like an emerald set in the blue
water. It serves as a quarantine station, and
the little snow-white buildings upon it appear like
toy houses. The small city is spread out among
cocoa-palms, ornamental and shade trees. The
green of the foliage of these trees is continuous
with the forest-clad mountains which form the
background of the beautiful plateau on which the
city is built. The harbor of Papeete is land and
reef-locked, small, but deep enough to float the
largest steamers plying in the Pacific Ocean. As
the steamer came up slowly to the wharf,
hundreds of people, a strange mixture of natives,
half-castes, Europeans and Chinese, old and
young, dressed in clothes of all imaginable colors,
red being by far the most predominant, crowded
the dock. Many of the children were naked,
and not a few of the men and boys were
unencumbered by clothing, with the exception of the
typical, much checkered Tahitian cotton
loin-cloth. A number of handsome carriages brought
the élite of the city to take part in this most
important of all monthly events.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They come to see; they come to be seen.</p>
<p>OVIDIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Custom-house officers, uniformed native
policemen, government officials, French soldiers and
merchants, mingled with the dusky natives and
contributed much to the uniqueness of the
landing-scene. The dense, motley crowd was anxious
to see and be seen, but was orderly and well
behaved. The custom-house officers were
accommodating and courteous, and passed our
hand-baggage without inspection. On the wharf was
a small mountain of cocoanuts, in readiness to
be loaded as a part of the return cargo of the
<em>Mariposa</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-city-of-papeete">
<h1>THE CITY OF PAPEETE</h1>
<p>Papeete is the capital of Tahiti, the seat of
government of the entire archipelago, and the
principal commercial city of the French
possessions in Oceanica. It is a typical city of the
South Sea world, as it is viewed from the deck
of the steamer and while walking or riding along
its narrow, crooked streets. From the harbor,
little can be seen of its buildings, except the
spire of the cathedral and the low steeples of two
Protestant churches, the low tower of the
governor's palace, formerly the home of royalty, the
military hospital, the wharf, and a few business
houses loosely scattered along the principal
street, the Quai du Commerce that skirts the
harbor. The residence part of the city is hidden
behind towering cocoa-palms and magnificent
shade-trees among which the flamboyant (burau)
trees are the most beautiful. It is situated on
a low plateau with a background of
forest-clad mountains, the beautiful little harbor, the
spray-covered coral reef, the vast ocean and the
picturesque outlines of Moorea in front of it.</p>

<p class="caption">IN THE SHADOW OF THE PALM FOREST</p>
</div>
<p>Papeete has no sidewalks. The streets are
narrow, irregularly laid out, and none of them
paved. Most of the houses are one-story frame
buildings, covered with corrugated iron roofs.
There are only two or three large stores; the
remaining business-places are small shops, many
of them owned and managed by Chinamen. The
present population, made up of natives of all
tints, from a light chocolate to nearly white, six
to eight hundred whites and about three hundred
Chinese, numbers in the neighborhood of five
thousand, nearly half of the population of the
entire island. There are about five hundred
Chinese in the island, who, by their industry and
knowledge of business methods, have become
formidable competitors of the merchants from
other foreign countries. Their small shops and
coffee-houses in Papeete and the country districts
are well patronized by the natives.</p>
<p>Papeete is the commercial center of Oceanica.
There are no department stores there. Business
is specialized more there than perhaps in any
other city. All of the shops, even the largest, look
small in the eyes of Americans. There are dry
goods stores, grocery stores, millinery shops, two
small frame hotels, the Hotel Francais and
another smaller one, both on the Quai, a few
boarding-houses, two saloons, and no bank. The
scarcity of saloons can be explained by the fact
that the natives are temperate in their habits.
According to a law enforced by the government,
the native women are prohibited from
frequenting such places.</p>
<p>The public wash-basin, supplied with running
fresh water from a mountain stream, is a sight
worth seeing. From a dozen to twenty native
women, and a few soldiers, may be found here
almost any time of the day, paddling knee-deep
in the water, using stones in place of washboards
in performing their arduous work. This
primitive way of washing gives excellent results,
judging from the snow-white, spotless linen
garments worn by the Europeans and well-to-do
natives.</p>
<p>The little plaza or square in the center of the
city is used as a market-place where natives
congregate at five o'clock in the morning, to make
their modest purchases of fish, plantain,
pineapple, melon or preserved shrimp done up in
joints of bamboo. This is the place to learn what
the islanders produce, sell and buy.</p>
<p>The public buildings are well adapted for a
tropic climate. The most important of these is
the palace of the last of the Tahitian kings, now
used as the office of the government. It is a
handsome white building, surrounded by ample
grounds well laid out, and beautified by trees,
shrubs and flowers. The government
schoolhouse is an enormous frame building, resting
upon posts, several feet from the ground, with
more than one-half of its walls taken up by
arched windows, the best lighted and most
thoroughly ventilated building in the city, an
ideal schoolhouse for the tropics. Among the
churches of different denominations, the
Catholic cathedral is the largest and best, although in
the States it would not be considered an ornament
for a small country village.</p>
<p>The city is well supplied with pure water from
a mountain stream, but lacks a system of
sewerage. The gardens and grounds of the best
residences of the foreigners present an exquisite
display of flowers that flourish best in the tropic
soil, under the invigorating rays of the tropic
sun, and the soothing effects of the frequent
showers of rain, which are not limited to any
particular season of the year.</p>
<p>Papeete, like all cities in the equatorial region,
is a city of supreme idleness and freedom from
care. The citizens can not comprehend that
&quot;The great principle of human satisfaction
is engagement&quot; (Paley). This idleness is
inherent in the natives, and under the climatic
conditions, and I suppose to a certain extent by
suggestion, is soon acquired by the foreigners.
Contentment and absence of anxiety characterize
the life of the Tahitian. He has no desire to
accumulate wealth; he is satisfied with little. He
is &quot;shut up in measureless content&quot;
(Shakespeare); he is inspired with the good idea that
&quot;he that maketh haste to be rich, shall not be
innocent&quot; (Proverb xxviii: 20). The merchants
open their shops at sunrise, lock the doors at ten,
retire to their homes for breakfast, take their
two-hour siesta, return to their business, suspend
work at five, and the remainder of the day and
the entire evening are devoted to rest, social visits
and divers amusements. The social center of
the foreigners is the Cercle Bougainville, a small
frame building which serves the purpose of a
club house. Bicycling is a favorite means of
travel and sport for the Europeans as well as the
natives of all classes. This vehicle has found its
way not only into the capital city but also into the
country districts throughout the island. The
splendid macadamized road which encircles the
island furnishes a great inducement for this sport.
Two of the wealthiest citizens travel the
principal streets in the city and the ninety-mile drive
in the most modern fashion by riding an
automobile.</p>
<p>There are few if any door locks in private
residences, hotels and boarding-houses, the best
possible proof that the inhabitants are
law-abiding citizens. In the boarding-house in which
I lived, the main entrance was left wide open
during the night, and none of the door locks
was supplied with a key. The native women wear
Mother Hubbard gowns of bright calico; the
better class of men dress in European fashion,
while the laborers and men from the country
districts wear a pareu (loin-cloth) of bright
calico, with or without an undershirt. The
average Tahitian does not believe in:</p>

<h1>TOPOGRAPHY OF THE ISLAND</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Into the silent land!</p>
<p>Ah, who shall lead us thither?</p>
<p>VON SALIS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no spot on earth more free from care,
worry and unrest than the island of Tahiti. The
abundance with which nature here has provided
for the wants of man, the uniform soothing
climate, the calmness of the Pacific Ocean, the
pleasing scenery quiet the nerves, induce sleep
and reduce to a minimum the efforts of man in
the struggle for life. It is the island of peace,
contentment and rest, a paradise on earth.</p>
<p>No writer has ever done justice to the natural
beauties of this gem of the South Seas. The
towering mountains, the tropical forests, the
numerous rippling streams of crystal water,
shaded dark ravines, the palm-fringed shore, the
lagoons with their quiet, peaceful, clear waters
painted in most exquisite colors of all shades of
green, blue and salmon by the magic influence of
the tropical sun, their outside wall of coral reef
ceaselessly kissed by the caressing, foaming,
moaning surf, the near-by picturesque island of
Moorea, with its precipitous mountains rising
from the deep bed of the sea, the flat basin-like,
palm-fringed atolls in the distance, and the vast
ocean beyond, make up a combination of pictures
of which the mind never tires, and which engrave
themselves indelibly on the tablet of memory.</p>
<p>Tahiti is a typical mountain island, protected
against the aggressive ocean by a coral reef
which forms almost a complete wall around it,
enclosing lagoons of much beauty, which teem
with a great variety of fish. It is thirty-five
miles in length, and on an average twelve miles
in breadth. It is shaped somewhat in the form
of an hourglass, the narrow part at Isthmus
Terrawow. The circuit of the island by
following the coast is less than one hundred and twenty
miles. The ninety-mile drive which engirdles the
island cuts off some of the irregular projections
into the sea. The interior is very mountainous
and cut into ravines so deep that it has never been
inhabited to any extent. The highest peaks are
Orohena and Aorii, from seven to eight thousand
feet in height, the former cleft into two points
of rock which are often draped with dark masses
of tropic clouds. Numerous other peaks of
lesser magnitude are crowded together in the
center of the island, their broad foundations
encroaching upon the plain. The people live on the
narrow strip of low land at the base of the
mountains and running down to the shore, where
the soil is exceedingly fertile and always well
watered by numerous rivers, brooks and rivulets.
Numberless cascades can be seen from the
ninety-mile drive, leaping over cliffs and appearing like
silver threads in the dark green of the
mountain-sides. The strip of arable land at the base of the
mountains varies in width from the bare
precipitous cliffs, without even a beach, to one, or
perhaps in the widest places, two miles. The
larger streams have cut out a few broader valleys.
It is this narrow strip of land which is inhabited,
the little villages being usually located near the
mouth of a river on the coast-line, insuring for
the inhabitants a pure water-supply and facilities
for fresh-water bathing, a frequent and pleasant
pastime for the natives of both sexes and all
ages.</p>
<p>Wherever there is sufficient depth of soil,
vegetation is rampant. The fertility of the soil and
the stimulating effect of constant moisture on
vegetable life are best seen by the vitality
exhibited by the fence-posts. I have seen fence-posts
a foot and more in circumference, after being
implanted in the soil, strike root, sprout and
develop into trees of no small size. The
mountains, and more especially the ravines, are heavily
timbered. There is no place on earth where the
scenery is more beautiful and sublime than at
many points along the ninety-mile drive. The
lofty mountains, the fertile plain, the many rivers,
brooks, rivulets and glimpses of foaming
cascades, lagoons, of the surf beating the coral reef
in the distance, the limitless ocean beyond, the
luxuriant rampant vegetation, the beautiful
flowers, the majestic palm-trees, the quaint villages
and their interesting inhabitants, form a picture
which is beautiful, and, at the same time, sublime.
As a whole it is sublime; in detail, beautiful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beauty charms, sublimity awes us, and is often accompanied
with a feeling resembling fear; while beauty rather
attracts and draws us towards it.</p>
<p>FLEMING.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us see how Captain Cook was impressed
with Tahiti when he first cast his eyes upon this
gem of the Pacific:</p>
<blockquote>
Perhaps there is scarcely a spot in the universe that
affords a more luxuriant prospect than the southeast
part of Otaheite [Tahiti.] The hills are high and steep,
and, in many places, craggy. But they are covered to
the very summits with trees and shrubs, in such a
manner that the spectator can scarcely help thinking
that the very rocks possess the property of producing
and supporting their verdant clothing. The flat land
which bounds those hills toward the sea, and the
interjacent valleys also, teem with various productions that
grow with the most exuberant vigour; and, at once, fill
the mind of the beholder with the idea that no place
upon earth can outdo this, in the strength and beauty
of vegetation. Nature has been no less liberal in
distributing rivulets, which are found in every valley, and
as they approach the sea, often divide into two or three
branches, fertilizing the flat lands through which they
run.</blockquote>
<p>Tahiti is the same to-day as when Captain
Cook visited it for the first time. The only
decided changes which have taken place since
are the building up of the capital city Papeete,
and the construction of the ninety-mile drive.
The beauty of the island has been maintained
because the natives have preserved the
magnificent primeval forests. Strip Tahiti of its
forests and it will be made a desert in a few years.
Nature relies on the forests to attract the clouds
which bring the moisture, and assist in the
formation and preservation of the soil. Remove the
trees, and drouth and floods will destroy
vegetation, and the latter will wash the existing soil
into the hungry abyss of the ocean. Fertile and
beautiful as Captain Cook found Tahiti, he
deprecated the idea of settling it with whites.</p>
<blockquote>
Our occasional visits may, in some respects, have
benefited its inhabitants; but a permanent
establishment amongst them, conducted as most European
establishments amongst Indian nations have
unfortunately been, would, I fear, give them just cause to
lament that our ships had ever found them out. Indeed,
it is very unlikely that any measure of this kind should
ever be seriously thought of, as it can neither serve the
purposes of public ambition, nor of private avarice;
and, without such inducements, I may pronounce, that
it will never be undertaken.</blockquote>
<p>The island has been invaded and taken by the
whites and the results to the natives have been in
many respects disastrous, which goes to prove
the correctness of Captain Cook's prophecy.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-climate">
<h1>THE CLIMATE</h1>
<p>The climate of Tahiti, although tropical, is
favorably influenced by the trade-winds and
frequent showers. The breezes from ocean and
land keep the heated atmosphere in motion, and
the frequent rains throughout the year have a
direct effect in lowering the temperature. The
entire island from the shore to the highest
mountain-peaks, is covered by forests and a vigorous
vegetation. These retain the moisture and
attract the pregnant clouds, securing, throughout
the year, a sufficient rainfall to feed the many
mountain streams and water the rich soil of the
mountain-sides, valleys, ravines and lowlands
along the coast. The temperature seldom exceeds
90 degrees Fahrenheit, and during the coldest
months, March and April, it occasionally falls
as low as 65 degrees Fahrenheit.
The atmosphere is charged with humidity, and when this
condition reaches the maximum degree, the heat
is oppressive, more especially when there is no
land or ocean breeze. If a hotel could be built
at an elevation of three to four thousand feet
above the level of the sea, the guests would find
a climate which could not be surpassed in any
other part of the world. A prolonged residence
in Papeete or any other part of the island near
the sea-level is debilitating for the whites. Those
of the white inhabitants who can afford it, leave
the island every three or five years and seek
recuperation and a renewal of energy in a cooler
climate, usually in California or Europe. Papeete,
partially enclosed by mountains, and only a few
feet above the level of the sea, and on the
leeward side of the island, is said to be one of the
warmest places in the island. The village of
Papara gets the full benefit of the trade-winds
and the land-breeze, and is one of the coolest
spots in Tahiti. Tahiti's summer-time is our
winter. I was fortunate in visiting the island
during the latter part of January. It is the time
when Nature makes a special effort here to
produce the luxuriant vegetation after the
drenching rains of December. It is the time when the
evergreen trees cast off, here and there, a faded
leaf, to be replaced by a new one from the
vigorous unfolding buds. It is the season of flowers
and the greatest variety of fruits. It may
interest the reader to know that one day seven
different kinds of fruits were served at the
breakfast-table, a luxury out of reach of our millionaires at
their homes in the North at that time of the year.
For a winter vacation, the months of
January and February offer the greatest
inducements. Those who are in need of an ideal mental
rest, and are fond of a long ocean voyage, and
enjoy tropic scenery and the marvelous products
of the fertile soil of the tropics, should not fail
to visit Tahiti, the little paradise in the midst of
the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<div class="section" id="history-of-the-island">
<h1>HISTORY OF THE ISLAND</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>History is the witness of the times, the torch of
truth, the life of memory, the teacher of life, the
messenger of antiquity.</p>
<p>CICERO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was my privilege during my brief stay in
Tahiti to meet Tati Salmon, chief of the Papara
district. He is a direct descendant of one of the
two noble families of the island, the Tevas, and
one of the most prominent and influential citizens
of the island. I asked him to what race the
Tahitians belonged. To this question he had a
ready reply. He said: &quot;We belong to no race;
man was created here; this is the lost Garden of
Eden.&quot; There is much force, if not truth, in
this assertion when we take into consideration
the charming beauty of the island and the
bounteous provisions which Nature has made here for
the existence of man. Then, too, the Tahitian
is a good specimen of manhood, intellectually and
physically, far superior to the Negro race and
the Mongolian. Ariitaimai (Arii Taimai E), the
mother of the chief just referred to and the
authoress of the book mentioned in the preface,
believes that the Tahitians belong to the great
Aryan race, the race of Arii, and that their
chiefs were Arii, not kings, and the head chiefs,
Ariirahi—Great Chiefs. It was only the latter
who were entitled to wear the girdle of red
feathers, as much the symbol of their preeminence
as the crown and sceptre of European royalty.
The Tahitians are Polynesians, like the
inhabitants of most of the South Seas and of Hawaii,
and there can be but little doubt that the
Polynesians belong to the Malay race, having migrated
from island to island, from west to east, by way
of Java, Samoa and the Hawaiian Islands. As
these voyages had to be made by means of frail
canoes, we can readily conceive the hardships
endured by the bold navigators of centuries ago.
A story current in Tahiti relates that it was thus
that the great chief Olopaua of Hawaii, driven
from home by disastrous floods, bore his wife
Lu'ukia in the twelfth century, to find a new
dwelling place in Tahiti, twenty-three hundred
miles away. It is said that the chiefess was a
poetess, a dancer famed for grace, and the
inventor of a style of dress which is still made by
the Hawaiians. Many of the primitive peoples
trace their origin to a legend which is handed
down from generation to generation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all ages of the world there is nothing with which
mankind hath been so much delighted as with those
little fictitious stories which go under the name of fables
or apologues among the ancient heathens, and of
parables in the sacred writings.</p>
<p>BISHOP PORTEUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Tevas of Tahiti have their legend and it
is related by Ariitaimai, as it has been told for
many generations. They take pride in the story
that they are the direct descendants from the
Shark God. The legend tells how many
centuries ago a chief of Punaauia, by the name of
Te manutu-ruu, married a chiefess of Vaiari,
named Hototu, and had a son, Terii te moanarau.
At the birth of the child, the father set out in
his canoe for the Paumotu Islands to obtain red
feathers (Ura) to make the royal belt for the
young prince. The legend begins by assuming
that Vaiari was the oldest family, with its Maraes,
and that Punaauia was later in seniority and rank.
While Te manutu-ruu was absent on his long
voyage to the Paumotus, a visitor appeared at
Vaiari, and was entertained by the chiefess. This
visitor was the first ancestor of the Tevas. He
was only half human, the other half fish, or Shark
God; and he swam from the ocean, through the
reef, into the Vaihiria River, where he came
ashore, and introduced himself as Vari
mataauhoe, and, after having partaken of the
hospitalities of the chiefess, took up his residence with
her. But after their intimacy had lasted some
time, one day, when they were together, Hototu's
dog came into the house and showed his
affection for his mistress by licking her face, or,
as we should say now, kissed her, although in
those days this mark of affection was unknown,
as the Polynesians instead only touched noses
as an affectionate greeting. At this the
man-shark was so displeased that he abandoned the
chiefess. He walked into the river, turned fish
again and swam out to sea. On his way he met
the canoe of the Chief Te manutu-ruu returning
from the Paumotus, and stopped to speak to him.
The chief invited Vari mataauhoe to return with
him, but the man-shark declined, giving as his
reason that the chiefess was too fond of dogs.</p>

<p class="caption">AVENUE OF PURRANUIA, PAPEETE</p>
</div>
<p>The legend proves that the natives regarded
Vaiari as the source of their aristocracy. Papara
makes the same claim, for when Vari mataauhoe
left Hototu he said to her: &quot;You will bear me a
child; if a girl, she will belong to you and take
your name; but if a boy, you are to call him
Teva; rain and wind will accompany his birth,
and to whatever spot he goes, rain and wind will
always foretell his coming. He is of the race of
Ariirahi, and you are to build him a Marae
which you are to call Matava (the two eyes of
Tahiti), and there he is to wear the Marotea,
and he must be known as the child of Ahurei
(the wind that blows from Taiarapu).&quot; A boy
was born, and, as foretold, in rain and wind.
The name of Teva was given to him; and Matoa
was built; and there Teva ruled. From this boy
came the name Teva; but when and how it was
applied to the clan no one knows. The members
of the tribe or clan believe it must have been
given by the Arii of Papara or Vaiari. To this
day, the Tevas seldom travel without rain and
wind, so that they use the word Teva
rarivari—Teva wet always and everywhere. The Vaiari
people still point out the place where the first
ancestor of the clan lived as a child, his first
bathing place, and the different waters in which
he fished as he came on his way toward Papara.
This legend is to-day as fresh in the district of
Papara as it was centuries ago. It is but natural
that the Tevas, one of the two most influential
and powerful of the tribes of Tahiti, should be
anxious to trace their ancestry to a royal origin
even if the first ancestor should be a man-shark,
little remembering that</p>

<p>It is not wealth nor ancestry, but honorable conduct
and a noble disposition that make men great.</p>
<p>OVIDIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the Tahitians had no written language
before the missionaries visited the island, little
is known of its earlier history. The history
of the island since its discovery has been
accurately written up by Ariitaimai, an eye-witness of
many of the most stirring events and on that
account most to be relied upon, for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only good histories are those that have been
written by the persons themselves who commanded in
the affairs whereof they write.</p>
<p>MONTAIGNE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us follow her account of the history of
the island since its discovery by Captain Samuel
Wallis, June 18, 1767. The captain made a
voyage around the world in Her Majesty's ship
<em>Dolphin</em>, and on his way found the island, and
called it Otaheite. At that time, Amo was head
chief of Papara and of the Tevas, or rather his
son Teriirere, born about 1762, was head chief,
and Amo exercised power as his guardian,
according to native custom, which made the
eldest child immediately on birth, the head of the
family. At that time the power of calling the
Tevas to conference or war was peculiar to the
Papara head chief; the military strength of the
Tevas was unconquerable, if it could be united;
but perhaps the most decisive part of every
head chief's influence was his family connection.
Nowhere in the world was marriage a matter of
more political and social consequence than in
Tahiti. Women occupied an important position
in society and political affairs. The chiefesses
held the reins of government with as much
firmness as the chiefs, and commanded the same
influence and respect. She was as independent
of her husband as of any other chief; she had her
seat or throne, in the Marae even to the
exclusion of her husband; and if she were ambitious
she might win or lose crowns for her children
as happened with Captain Wallis' friend Oberea,
the great-aunt of Ariitaimai Purea, and with her
niece, Tetuauni reiaiteatea, the mother of the
first King Pomare. At the time of Wallis' and
Cook's visits, Papara was the principal city in
Tahiti, and Papeete, the present capital city of the
French possessions in Oceanica, a mere village.
The Papara head chief was never the head chief
of the whole island, but his power and influence
were predominant throughout the whole island.
The kingship which Europeans insisted on
conferring on him, or on any other head chief who
happened for the time to rival him, was never
accepted by the natives until forced upon them
by foreign influence and arms. From this it will
be seen that before European influence made
itself felt, the Tahitians were divided into tribes
ruled by so many chiefs, with a head chief
whose influence extended over the entire island.
The form of native government was very simple
and had many very commendable features. Wars
between the tribes and between Tahiti and the
neighboring island, Moorea, were, however, of
frequent occurrence.</p>

</div>
<p>All exact knowledge concerning dates in the
history of the island begins with June 24, 1767,
when Wallis warped his ship into the bay of
Matavai, the most northerly point of the island.
The appearance of the foreigners, the first time
the natives had ever seen a white man and such a
great ship, created consternation. Excitement
ran high on the landing of the crew. The natives
attacked them, but their rude implements of
warfare could not cope with firearms, and they
were defeated. Two days later, June 26th, the
battle was renewed and again terminated in the
defeat of the natives, promptly followed by
sudden friendship for their first European
visitors. The natives, extremely superstitious,
were at first suspicious, and it required some time
to establish free relations between them and the
commander and crew of the <em>Dolphin</em>. Strangely
enough, the first native to board the ship was a
woman. The incident is related by Wallis
himself:</p>
<blockquote>
On Saturday, the 11th, in the afternoon, the gunner
came on board with a tall woman, who seemed to be
about five and forty years of age, of a pleasing
countenance and majestic deportment. He told me that she
was but just come into that part of the country, and that
seeing great respect paid her by the rest of the natives,
he had made her some presents; in return for which
she had invited him to her home, which was about two
miles up the valley, and given him some large hogs;
after which she returned with him to the watering-place
and expressed a desire to go on board the ship, in
which wish he had thought it proper, on all accounts,
that she should be gratified. She seemed to be under
no restraint, either from diffidence or fear, when she
came into the ship, and she behaved all the while she
was on board with an easy freedom that always
distinguishes conscious superiority and habitual command.
I gave her a large blue mantle that reached from her
shoulders to her feet, which I drew over her, and tied on
with ribbons; I gave her also a looking-glass, beads of
several sorts, and many other things, which she accepted
with good grace and much pleasure. She took notice
that I had been ill, and pointed to the shore. I
understood that she meant I should go thither to perfect my
recovery, and I made signs that I would go thither the
next morning. When she intimated an inclination to
return, I ordered the gunner to go with her, who, having
set her on shore, attended her to her habitation, which
he described as being very large and well built. He
said that in this house she had many guards and
domestics, and that she had another at a little distance
which was enclosed in lattice work.</blockquote>
<p>This visit opened the island to the
Englishmen. Wallis repeatedly refers to his first visitor
as &quot;my princess, or rather queen.&quot; When he
came on shore the next day he was met by the
princess, who ordered that he and the first
lieutenant and purser, who were also ill, should be
carried by the people to her home, where they
were treated in a most hospitable manner. Here
is a beautiful instance of natural hospitality,
charity and gratitude combined; a kindly deed
dictated by unselfish motives, an exhibition of
virtues so rarely met with in the common walks
of life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hospitality to the better sort and charity to the poor;
two virtues that are never exercised so well as when
they accompany each other.</p>
<p>ATTERBURY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The princess had full control over the curious,
motley crowd, which gave way to the strangers
by a sign of her hand. The house proved to be
the Fare-hau, or Council-house, of Haapape, and
the princess, as Wallis called her, who did not
belong to Haapape, but to quite another part of
the island, was herself a guest whose presence
there was due to her relationship with the chief.</p>
<p>Wallis left the Island July 27th. His &quot;queen&quot;
and her attendants came on board and bade him
and his crew a most affectionate farewell.
Neither Wallis, nor Bougainville, who visited
Tahiti in April, 1768, eight months later, ever
learned what her true rank was, or from what
part of the island she came. According to
Ariitaimai, she was her great-great-grandaunt
Purea, or rather, the wife of her
great-great-granduncle.</p>
<p>Bougainville named the island New Cytherea,
and Commerson, the naturalist, charmed by its
beauty and astonished at its resources, called it
Utopia. The latter gave the following romantic
description of the island and its people in a letter
published in the <em>Mercure de France</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
Je puis vous dire que c'est le seul coin de la terre ou
habitent des hommes sans vices, sans préjugés, sans
besoins, sans dissensions. Nés sous le plus beau ciel,
nourris des fruits d'une terre féconde sans culture, régis
par des pères de famille plutôt que par des rois, ils ne
connaissent d'autre dieu que l'Amour. Tous les jours
lai sont consacrés, toute l'isle son temple, toutes les
femmes—me demandez-vous? Les rivales des
Geôrgiennes en beauté et les sœurs des grâces toutes
unes.</blockquote>
<p>Such was the simple, innocent, happy island
life when Tahiti was discovered by the white
man, whose pretended object was to bring to
the natives the benefits of modern civilization.
As to the immediate effects of European
civilization on the morals of the natives, Ariitaimai
has the following to say in reply to the alleged
laxity of Tahitian morals:</p>
<blockquote>
No one knows how much of the laxity of morals was
due to the French and English themselves, whose
appearance certainly caused a sudden and shocking
overthrow of such moral rules as had existed before in
the island society: and the &quot;supposed&quot; means that when
the island society as a whole is taken into account.
Marriage was real as far as it went, and the standard
rather higher than that of Paris; in some ways
extremely lax, and in others strict and stern to a
degree that would have astonished even the most
conventional English nobleman, had he understood it</blockquote>
<p>The third European to visit Tahiti was that
intrepid explorer, Captain Cook, who entered
Matavai Bay on the 13th of April, 1769, in Her
Majesty's bark, the <em>Endeavor</em>, on his first voyage
around the world. He met chief Tootahah,
under whose protection he settled on Point
Venus. He was accompanied by a staff of
scientists, among them Joseph Banks and Dr.
Solander, a Swedish naturalist. Captain Wallis'
&quot;queen&quot; was again on the shore to meet the
strangers. Captain Cook gives a detailed
account of her visit:</p>
<blockquote>
She first went to Mr. Banks' tent at the fort, where
she was not known, till the master, who knew her,
happening to go ashore, brought her on board with
two men and several women, who seemed to be all of
her family. I made them all some presents or other,
but to Obariea (for that was the woman's name) I gave
several things, in return for which, as soon as I went
on shore with her, she gave me a hog and several
bunches of plantains. These she caused to be carried
from her canoes up to the fort in a kind of procession,
she and I bringing up the rear. This woman is about
forty years of age, and, like most of the other women,
very masculine. She is head or chief of her own family
or tribe, but to all appearance hath no authority over
the rest of the inhabitants, whatever she might have
when the <em>Dolphin</em> was here.</blockquote>

<p class="caption">NATIVE HUT CLOSE BY THE SEA</p>
</div>
<p>Cook ascertained at this time, that Obariea
was the wife of the most influential chief of the
island, Oamo, but did not live with him. She
had two children, a daughter eighteen years old,
and a boy of seven, the heir to the throne. He
says in his Journal:</p>
<blockquote>
The young boy above mentioned is son to Oamo and
Obariea, but Oamo and Obariea do not at this time live
together as man and wife, he not being able to endure
with her troublesome disposition. I mention this
because it shows that separation in the marriage state is
not unknown to these people.</blockquote>
<p>When Cook made his second visit to the island,
in 1774, he learned that Oamo and Obariea, or,
as they are called in the genealogy of the Tevas,
Amo and Purea, had been driven from Papara
into the mountains. Vehiatu, the victor, made
Amo resign, and the regency of that part of the
island was entrusted to Tootuhah, the youngest
brother of the deposed chief.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pomare-the-royal-family-of-tahiti">
<h1>POMARE, THE ROYAL FAMILY OF TAHITI</h1>
<p>The Pomare family are descendants of chiefs
called Tu of Faaraoa, one of the atoll islands
of the Paumotu Archipelago, some two hundred
and fifty miles northeast of Tahiti. The exact
date of the first Tu's arrival in Tahiti is unknown.
Even the generation can not be fixed. The
Pomares were always ashamed of their Paumotu
descent, which they regarded as a flaw in their
heraldry, and which was a reproach to them in
the eyes of the Tahitians, for all Tahitians
regarded the Paumotus as savage, and socially
inferior. The first Tu who came to visit the
distant land of Tahiti, came in by the Taunoa
opening, which is the eastern channel, into what
is now the harbor of Papeete. Landing at Taunoa
a stranger, he was invited to be the guest of
Manaihiti, who seems to have been a chief of
Pare. He was adopted by the chief as his
brother, and at the death of the chief, he
became heir and successor in the chief's line.
He married into the Arue family, which gave his
son a claim to the joint chiefdom of Pare Arue;
and at last his grandson, or some later
generation, obtained in marriage no less a personage
than Tetuaehuri, daughter of Taiarapu. One
of the members of this family, Teu (born 1720,
died 1802) made new and important advances
in the social and political circles of Tahiti by
marriage, and became the father of Pomare I.
(1743-1803), the first king of Tahiti. Teu seems
to have been a very clever and cautious man.
He never assumed to be a great chief or to wear
the belt of feathers. He was more jealous of his
son than of Amo or his son Teriirere. His son,
Tu, was born about 1743. Related by birth with
two of the most influential families, he
strengthened his native ties by marrying
Tetuanui-rea-i-te-rai, of the adjoining independent chiefdom
of Tefauai Ahurai, who was not only a niece of
Purea, but quite as ambitious and energetic as
Purea herself. The English, who could not
conceive that the Tahitians should be able to
exist without some pretense of royalty, gave Tu
the rank and title of king, notwithstanding that
he was only one, and at that not the most
influential of several Arii rahi. To the great
dissatisfaction of the other chiefs, Tu received the lion's
share of presents from Captain Cook. At this
action, the Ahurai and Attahura people were
enraged, and Cook was quite unable to
understand that they had reason to complain. To
them, Cook's partiality for Tu must have seemed
a deliberate insult. When Cook returned on his
third voyage, in 1777, several Tahitian tribes
were in a state of war with Moorea, in which Tu
took no active part. Cook then deliberately
intervened in the support of the plan he had
adopted of elevating Tu at the expense of the
other chiefs. In his estimation, Tu was king by
divine right, and any attack on his authority was
treason in the first place, and an attack on British
influence in the next. British influence and
British threats made a radical change in the
government of Tahiti, in opposition to the
expressed wish of the great majority of the people.
England wanted to control the political affairs
of the island for commercial gain, and to extend
her sovereignty in the South Seas, which only
confirms that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All government—indeed, every human benefit and
enjoyment, every virtue and every prudent act—is
founded on compromise and barter.</p>
<p>BURKE.</p>

</div>
<p>After Cook's departure, nearly eleven years
elapsed before another European ship called at
Tahiti, and, during this time, Pomare paid dearly
for the distinctions forced upon him by the
foreigners. When Lieutenant Bligh arrived in the
<em>Bounty</em>, in 1788, Tu told him that after five
years from the time of Cook's last departure,
the people of the island Moorea (Eirrieo) joined
with those of Attahura and made an attack
on his district, and many of his subjects were
killed, while he had himself fled, with the
survivors, to the mountains. All the houses and
property had been destroyed or carried away by the
enemy. Bligh landed at Matavai in the <em>Bounty</em>
October 26, 1788. He came for a supply of
breadfruit, which was to be introduced and
domesticated in the various tropical colonies of Great
Britain, and indirectly to advance the interests
and power of Tu, who had nearly lost his
influence over the natives. His position was so
desperate that he begged the lieutenant to take him
and his wife, Tetua, to England. He had a son,
at this time six years old, who became the first
Christian king of Tahiti. Before leaving the
island, April 3, 1789, Bligh did what he could
to strengthen Tu's position, and supplied him
with firearms. For this act he gave the following
explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
He (Tu) had frequently expressed a wish that I
would leave some firearms and ammunition with him,
as he expected to be attacked after the ship sailed, and
perhaps chiefly on account of our partiality to him. I
therefore thought it but reasonable to accede to his
request. I was the more readily prevailed on, as he said
his intentions were to act only on the defensive. This,
indeed, seems most suited to his disposition, which is
neither active nor enterprising. When I proposed to
leave with him a pair of pistols, which they prefer to
muskets, they told me that his wife, Tetua, would fight
with one and Oedidee with the other. Tetua has learned
to load and fire a musket with great dexterity, and
Oedidee is an excellent marksman. It is not common
for women in this country to go to war, but Tetua is a
very resolute woman, of a large make, and has great
bodily strength.</blockquote>
<p>History shows that Tetua was not the only
fighting woman in Tahiti, as at different times,
in tribal wars, it was not uncommon for women
to take an active part, and in more than one
instance the leading part.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On great occasions it is almost always women who
have given the strongest proofs of virtue and devotion;
the reason is, that with men, good and bad qualities
are in general the result of calculation, whilst in
women they are impulses, springing from the heart.</p>
<p>COUNT MONTHOLON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Bligh left the island April 4th.
As he was passing the Friendly, or Tonga group,
April 28th, the larger part of his officers and men
mutinied and set him and some eighteen others
adrift in the ship's launch. The mutineers then
put the ship about and returned to Tahiti, where
they arrived at Matavai Bay, June 6, 1789. There
they took in all the live-stock they could obtain,
and twenty-four Tahitians, and sailed again June
16th for Tubuai, but appeared once more,
September 22nd, and landed sixteen of the mutineers,
who were tired of their adventures. The rest
sailed suddenly the next night, and vanished
from the sight of men for twenty years. The
sixteen mutineers who remained scattered more
or less over the island, but made Pare their
headquarters and Tu their patron. Here they set
to work, November 12, 1789, to build a
thirty-foot schooner, with which to make their escape.
The effect of the example of these ruffians and
criminals on the morals of the simple, receptive
Tahitians can be readily imagined. These men,
who had enjoyed the confidence of their
commander and the advantages and pleasures of a
trip to foreign strange countries, proved
ungrateful, and &quot;the earth produces nothing worse
than an ungrateful man&quot; (Ansonius). The
schooner was launched August 5, 1790. The war
which immediately followed, and which
reestablished Tu in his power for the time, deserves to
be called the War of the Mutineers of the <em>Bounty</em>.
When Tu died, thirteen years later, the
missionaries in their Journal recorded many details
about his life and character, and among other
things, they said:</p>
<blockquote>
He was born in the district of Oparre, where his
corpse now is, and was by birth chief of that district,
and none other. The notice of the English navigators
laid the foundation for his future aggrandizement;
and the runaway seamen that from time to time quitted
their vessels to sojourn in the island (especially that
of His Majesty's ship <em>Bounty's</em> crew, which resided
here) were the instruments for gaining to Pomarre a
greater extent of dominion and power than any other
man had before in Otaheite.</blockquote>
<p>It is very evident that the first Pomare was
a man without firmness and that what influence
he exercised was due to the energies and ambition
of his wife and to foreign support. When
Lieutenant Bligh reached home and reported the
mutiny, the British government sent the frigate
<em>Pandora</em> in search of the <em>Bounty</em> and the deserted
crew. The <em>Pandora</em> never found the <em>Bounty</em>,
which long since had been burned by the
mutineers at Pitcairn Island; but she did find such of
the mutineers as had returned to Tahiti, and who
were actively engaged in establishing Tu as a
Tahitian despot, when the <em>Pandora</em>, in March,
1791, appeared in Matavai Bay. The mutineers,
it seems, unable to keep at sea in the rickety
schooner, landed at Papara, March 26th, and took
refuge in the mountains. Captain Edwards, of
the <em>Pandora</em>, immediately sent two boats, with
a number of men, to Papara. Through the
friendly office of the chiefs and natives, the
mutineers were finally captured, one by one,
until only six remained out, and these were at
last found near the seashore, where they were
captured after many fruitless attempts. The
<em>Pandora</em> sailed from Tahiti with her prisoners in
May, 1791, and in December following, Vancouver
arrived in the sloop of war <em>Discovery</em>, on a search
for a northwest passage to the Orient, stopping
for supplies at Tahiti, December 28th.</p>

<p>Vancouver, who had been with Cook in 1777,
inquired for his old friends. He learned that the
young king had taken the name of Otoo, and his
old friend that of Pomare, having given up his
name with his sovereign jurisdiction, though he
still seemed to retain his authority as regent.
This is the first record of the name Pomare, by
which the family has since been known. After
the birth of the young Tu, about 1782, the first
of his children who was allowed to live, the
father seems to have taken the name of Tuiah,
or Tarino, which he bore in 1788. He took the
name of Pomare (night cough) from his younger
son, Terii nava horoo, a young child in 1791, who
coughed at night. With the assistance of
English guns, Pomare waged active war on
neighboring chiefs, and the chief of Papara was the last
one to succumb. By successive vigorous strokes,
he finally gained control of the entire group of
islands, including Borabora.</p>

<h1>MISSIONARY RULE</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>It is better that men should be governed by
priestcraft than violence.</p>
<p>LORD MACAULEY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The early missionaries of Tahiti played an
important role in the island politics. They did
not limit their work to the conversion of the
heathen islanders, but took an active part in
political affairs, and many of their doings in that
direction were not in accord with the teachings of
the gospel. The first missionaries sent to Tahiti
from England reached the island in the <em>Duff</em>,
March, 1797. They received information of the
island politics from two Swedish sailors, Andrew
Lind, of the ship <em>Matilda</em>, which had been
wrecked in the South Sea in 1792, and Peter
Haggerstein, who deserted from the <em>Daedalus</em>
in February, 1793. Both of these men were
adventurers of the type that has infested the
South Seas for more than a century. They
became well-known characters in the history of
the island, sometimes assisting the
missionaries, and sometimes annoying them. In July,
1797, Peter accompanied one of the missionaries
as a guide and interpreter, on a circuit round the
island, to make a sort of census, as a
starting-point for the missionary work. They began with
Papenoo, July 11th, and as they walked, Peter
boasted of his exploits. His stories were so much
in conflict with facts that they rather misled
than aided the missionaries in search of island
affairs. Temarii, the chief of Papara, had
visited the missionaries at Matavai. The
missionaries gave the following account of him:</p>
<blockquote>
May 7, 1797, visited by the chief priest from Papara,
Temarre. He was dressed in a wrapper of Otaheitian
cloth, and over it an officer's coat doubled around
him. At his first approach he appeared timid, and
was invited in. He was just about seated when the
cuckoo clock struck and filled him with astonishment
and terror. Old Pyetea had brought the bird some
breadfruit, observing it must be starved if we never
fed it. At breakfast we invited Temarii to our repast,
but he first held out his hand with a bit of plantain
and looked very solemn, which, one of the natives said,
was an offering to Eatooa (Tahitian divinity) and we
must receive it. When we had taken it out of his hand
and laid it under the table, he sat down and made a
hearty breakfast. Brother Cover read the translated
address to all these respected guests, the natives
listening with attention, and particularly the priest, who
seemed to drink in every word, but appeared
displeased when urged to cast away their false gods, and
on hearing the names of Jehovah and Jesus he would
turn and whisper. Two days afterwards, Temarii came
again to the mission house and this time with the young
Otoo, Pomare H., and his first wife Tetuanui.</blockquote>
<p>Here again is the account of the visit by the
missionaries:</p>
<blockquote>
May 9th, Temarre accompanied the king and queen
and staid to dine with us. He is, we find, of the royal
race and son of the famed Oberea. He is the first chief
of the island after Pomarre, by whom he has been
subdued, and now lives in friendship with him and has
adopted his son. He is also high in esteem as a priest.</blockquote>
<p>In July of the same year the missionaries
visited Temarii at Papara on their way around
the island. They found the chief under the
influence of Kava, but were feasted the next day on
Temarii's feast pig. Not only was Temarii the
most powerful chief of the island, but Pomare
had become, by his son's accession, a chief of
the second order. He depended greatly on the
favor of his son, the young Tu, who was, in 1797,
supposed to be at least fifteen and perhaps
seventeen years of age, and who had been adopted
by Temarii, his cousin, who was about ten years
older than he. Adoption was rather stronger in
the South Seas than the tie of natural parentage.
Between his natural father, Pomare, and his
adopted father, Temarii, the young Tu preferred
the latter, and sooner or later every one knew
that Temarii would help Tu to emancipate
himself and drive Pomare from the island.</p>

<p class="caption">TAHITIAN BAMBOO HOUSE</p>
</div>
<p>The <em>Duff</em> sailed for England August 14, 1797,
leaving the missionaries to the mercies of rival
factions, and they soon ascertained that Pomare
and Tu were on anything but friendly terms.
The missionaries had faith in Pomare, who chose
one of them by the name of Cover as a brother.
Temarii chose another by the name of Main.
These two missionaries went to Papara August
15th, at the suggestion of the influential native
priest, Manne Manne, to remonstrate against
a human sacrifice which was to be made at the
Marae Tooarai. On account of a murder
recently committed, the missionaries found the
chief and people greatly excited, and fled as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In the month of March the missionaries found
themselves in a critical condition when the ship
<em>Nautilus</em> appeared and two of her crew deserted.
The deserters went to Pare and were sheltered
there. The captain of the <em>Nautilus</em> at once set
to work to recover them. Four of the
missionaries proceeded to Pare to see Tu, Pomare and
Temarii and informed them that a refusal to
return the men would be regarded as exhibiting
an evil intention against the missionaries. They
found Tu and Temarii at Pare, but went to get
Pomare to join them, when they were suddenly
attacked and stripped by some thirty natives, who
took their clothes and treated them rather
roughly, but at last released them. They went to
Pomare's house and were kindly received.
Pomare returned with them to Tu, and insisted
on the punishment of the offenders and the
delivery of the deserters. Two were executed, and
the district of Pare took up arms to avenge them.
Tu joined his father and suppressed the riot, so
that the missionaries' clothes cost the natives
fifteen lives before order was restored. This
incident made the missionaries very unpopular and
they had to depend more than ever on Pomare
for protection.</p>
<p>On August 24th, two whaling vessels, the
<em>Cornwall</em> and <em>Sally</em>, of London, anchored in
Matavai Bay, and most of the principal chiefs
went on board. On the 30th, while the
missionaries were at dinner, Pomare came in great haste,
and told them that a man had been blown up
with gunpowder at the Council house in Pare,
and requested them to hasten to the place and
render assistance. When they arrived they found
that the injured man was Temarii. Here is the
account of the affair by the missionaries:</p>
<blockquote>
At our arrival we were led to the bed of Temaree
called also Orepiah, and beheld such a spectacle as we
had never before seen. Brother Broomhall began
immediately to apply what he had prepared with a
camel's-hair brush over most parts of the body. He
was apparently more passive under the operation than
we could conceive a man in his situation would be
capable of. The night drawing on, we took leave of him
by saying we would return next morning with a fresh
preparation. On the following morning we were
struck with much surprise at the appearance of the
patient He was literally daubed with something like a
thick white paste. Upon inquiry we found it to be the
scrapings of yams. Both the chief and his wife seemed
highly offended at Brother Broomhall's application the
preceding evening, and they would not permit him to
do anything more for him, as he had felt so much pain
from what he had applied. It was said that there was
a curse put into the medicine by our God.</blockquote>
<p>It must be remembered that the Tahitian
chiefs were also priests and not infrequently
acted as physicians. The dissatisfaction of
Temarii with the treatment of his case by the
missionaries had therefore to be considered as a
most unfortunate affair. Under these conditions
the missionaries were apprehensive of
increasing hostilities. The suspicion on part of the
superstitious natives that the missionaries had
been sent by Pomare to curse Temarii and cause
his death was not only a natural but a reasonable
one to the chief as well as his subjects. Pomare
was quite capable of such conduct and as far
as the natives knew, the missionaries were
Pomare's friends and supporters. The accident
which gave rise to this unfortunate occurrence
was due to the English gunpowder and it was
fortunate that the missionaries had nothing to
do with furnishing it. The explosion occurred
while Temarii was testing the quality of powder
which he obtained from the whalers <em>Cornwall</em>
and <em>Sally</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
A pistol was loaded and unthinkingly fired in the
midst of a number of people, over the whole quantity
(five pounds) of powder received. A spark of fire
dropped from the pistol upon the powder that lay on
the ground, and in a moment it blew up. The natives
did not feel themselves hurt at first, but when the
smoke was somewhat dispersed, observing their skin
fouled with powder, they began to rub their arms, and
found the skin peeling off under their fingers. Terrified
at this, they instantly ran to a river near at hand and
plunged themselves in.</blockquote>
<p>Temarii lingered in great suffering till
September 8th, but the missionaries did not dare to
visit him again for fear of violence on the part of
the indignant natives. The whole body of chiefs
was present and looked on in consternation while
Temarii died. The chief's remains were carried,
in the usual state, round the island to all his
districts and duly mourned; and in the regular
course prescribed by the island ceremonial, his
head was secretly hidden in the cave at Papara.
These demonstrations served to spread the news
of the calamity, for which the missionaries
received the exclusive blame. The political
complications which followed induced Pomare to
seek safety in flight to the Paumotu Islands,
leaving his wife to face the storm. The chiefess
was not idle after her husband's cowardly flight.
On the 29th of November she compromised with
Tu by ceding to him the authority he wanted, and
obtained from him a pledge assuring her safety.
This guaranty was the life of the high priest, old
Manne Manne, Tu's best friend. He was
murdered by Tetuanui's people on his way from
Matavai to Pare. The chiefess was in the
missionaries' house when this news arrived. She
had a cartridge-box around her waist and a
musket near at hand. She shook hands in a
friendly manner with the Swede, saying unto
him, &quot;It is all over,&quot; meaning the war, and
immediately returned to her home. Pomare gained
nothing by these dissensions, for he had nothing
to gain, but had to sacrifice a part of his
possessions. The only winner in this tragic game was
the worst and most bloodthirsty of all, Tu, the
first Christian king. It must be remarked that
this king was the creation of the English, and
that he was used as a tool in the hands of the
missionaries. The Europeans came, and not only
upset all the moral ideas of the natives, but also
their whole political system. Before European
influence made itself felt in Tahiti, whenever a
chief became intolerably arrogant or dangerous,
the other chiefs united to overthrow him. All
the wars that are remembered in island traditions
were caused by the overweening pride, violence
or abnormal ambition of the great chiefs of
districts, and always ended in correcting existing
evils and in restoring the balance of power.</p>
<p>The English came just at the time when one
of these revolutions was in progress. The whole
island had united to punish the chiefess of Papara
for outrageous disregard of the island courtesies
which took the place of international law between
great chiefs. Purea had taken away the symbol
of sovereignty she had assumed for her son, and
had given it for safe-keeping to the chief of
Paea. The natives and chiefs had recognized
the chief of Pare, Arue, as entitled to wear the
Maro-ura, which Purea had denied him by
insulting his wife. Then the chief of Paea had tried
to imitate Purea and assert supreme authority,
only to be in his turn defeated and killed.</p>

<p class="caption">TOMB OF THE LAST KING OF TAHITI, POMARE V.</p>
</div>
<p>Probably Tu would never have attempted a
similar course if the English had not insisted on
recognizing and treating him as king of the
whole island. He was one of the weakest of the
chiefs and enjoyed little if any reputation as a
military power. The other chiefs would have
easily kept him in his proper place if the English
had not constantly supported him and restored
him to power when he was vanquished. English
interference and the assistance of the
missionaries prolonged his ambition and caused the
constant revolutions which gave no chance for the
people to recover from the losses. Pomare was
a shrewd politician and with the assistance of
English guns finally gained control over the
whole island, crushing tribal rule, the safeguard
of the people under his despotic rule. All
visitors to the island became aware how
desperately the unfortunate people struggled against
the English policy of creating and supporting a
tyranny. The brutality and violence of Tu made
him equally hated by his own people of Pare
and by the Teva districts. Of these facts the
missionaries had full knowledge, as is evident
from their numerous correspondents,
nevertheless, they assisted him in carrying out his plans
to gain control over the entire island. They
supplied him freely with firearms and
ammunition. To preserve peace the missionaries did
some very curious things which suggest, as they
hinted, that they were glad to see the natives
fighting together, as is evident from one of their
daily records:</p>
<blockquote>
August 20, 1800.—We hear great preparations are
making, whether for war or peace is to be determined
in a short time, by some heathenish divination. If it
should prove for war, those who are eager for blood
seem determined to glut themselves, we rejoice that the
Lord of Hosts is the God of the heathen as well as the
Captain of the Armies of Israel; and while the
potsherds of the earth are dashing themselves to pieces one
against the other, they are fulfilling his determinate
counsels and foreknowledge.</blockquote>
<p>In the month of June Pomare instituted a
wholesale massacre to subject the entire island
to his rule, and by brutal force gained the object
of his ambition. In 1808 the political situation
was such that the missionaries found it necessary
for their safety to leave the island, and fled with
Pomare, November 12th, to the island of Moorea.
Pomare's cruelties and atrocities practiced upon
the natives during his tyrannical rule are well
described in a pen-picture drawn by Moerenhout:</p>
<blockquote>
After having massacred all whom they had surprised
(in Attahura), after having burned the houses, they
went on to Papara, where Tati, who is still living (1837),
was chief; but fortunately a man who had escaped from
the carnage of Punaauia came to warn the inhabitants
of Papara, so that they had time, not to unite in
defense, but to fly. Nevertheless, in that infernal night
and the day following a great number of persons
perished, especially old men, women and children; and
among the victims were the widow and children of
Aripaia (Ariifaataia) Amo's son, who, surprised the next
evening near Taiarahu, were pitilessly massacred with
all their attendants. Tati and some of his warriors
succeeded in reaching a fort called Papeharoro, at
Mairepehe; but they were too few to maintain themseives
there, and were forced to take refuge in the most
inaccessible parts of the high mountains, from whence
this chief succeeded in getting to a canoe which some
of his faithful followers provided for him, and kept in
readiness on the shore, at the peril of their lives. With
him were his brother and his young son, whom he
had himself carried in his arms during all this time of
fatigue and dangers.</blockquote>
<p>Opuhara became chief of Papara, and soon
afterward chief of the island, and remained the
chief personage of Tahiti during the next seven
years. Ellis, the historian of the missionaries,
described him as an intelligent and interesting
man.</p>
<p>At Moorea, Pomare's friends were
Paumotuans, Boraborans, Raiateans, missionaries, and
outcasts. Even these at last abandoned him.
The missionary journal shows that they had
long regarded their work as a failure, and after
identifying themselves with Pomare, in spite of
emphatic warnings, no other result was possible.
So the missionaries, leaving only Mr. Nott at
Moorea, sailed for Australia, not daring to
accept the proffered protection of the Tahiti
chiefs, because they could not separate
themselves, in the minds of the common people, from
Pomare and his interests. At Moorea, Pomare
urged the visiting chiefs to become Christians.
On the 18th of July, 1812, he announced his own
decision to the missionaries, and shortly
afterwards, on invitation from his old district of Pare
Arue, he returned to Tahiti, where he was
permitted to remain for two years, as an avowed
Christian, unmolested by his old enemies. He
took up his residence at Pare Arue as a Christian
chief, August 13, 1812, and kept up a
correspondence with the missionaries at Moorea.</p>
<p>The missionaries returned and were more
successful in Christianizing the people. On the
17th of February, 1813, Pomare wrote: &quot;Matavai
has been delivered up to me. When I am
perfectly assured of the sincerity of this surrender
I will write to you another letter.&quot; The
missionaries made a tour of the island; many
conversions took place; in Moorea several idols were
publicly burned; there could be no doubt that
the Christians were pursuing an active course,
and that their success would bring back the
authority of Pomare over the whole island; but
neither Opuhara nor Tati interfered, and the
peace remained. Yet, after waiting two years
at Pare, vainly expecting the restoration of his
government, and endeavoring to recover his
authority in his hereditary districts, Pomare
returned to Moorea in the autumn of 1814,
accompanied by a large train of adherents and
dependents, all professing Christianity. At the
same time the Christian converts in Tahiti
became an organization known as the Bure Atua,
and every one could see that Pomare was making
use of them, and of his wife's resources, to begin
a new effort to recover by force his authority
in the island. War was inevitable, and Pomare,
with his Christian followers and missionaries,
could choose the time and place.</p>
<p>Pomare himself was not a soldier, nor had he
anything of a soldierly spirit. He left active
campaigning to his wives, who were less likely
to rouse the old enmity. His two wives, Terite
and Pomare vehine, came over to Pare Arue
May, 1815, with a large party of Christians,
and urged their plans for the overthrow of the
native chiefs. The chiefs had no other alternative
than to get rid of them, and fixed the night of
July 7th for the combined attack. Opuhara led
the forces, and it is said that he had given the
two queens timely warning to effect their escape.
For his delay some of the other chiefs charged
him with treachery. He replied that he wished
no harm to the two women or their people; that
his enemies were the Parionuu; and he marched
directly into Pare Arue, and subdued it once
more.</p>

<p class="caption">TAHITIAN WOMEN IN ANCIENT NATIVE DRESS</p>
</div>
<p>While Pomare and the missionaries grew
stronger, and, as Ellis expressed it, &quot;became
convinced that the time was not very remote when
their faith and principles must rise preeminent
above the power and influence&quot; of the native
chiefs, the chiefs themselves exhibited vacillation.
Pomare returned, with all his following,
apparently armed and prepared for war. The native
converts were trained to the use of firearms and
the whole missionary interest became, for the
moment, actively militant. The native chiefs
remained passive. Under the appearance of
religious services, Pomare and the missionaries
kept their adherents under arms and prepared
them for any hostilities that might arise.</p>
<p>With his army numbering eight hundred, two
war canoes, one manned with musketeers, the
other with a swivel gun in the stern, commanded
by a white man, Pomare, on November 11th,
took possession at or near the village of Punaauia,
near Papara, with pickets far in advance.
Opuhara hastily summoned his men in the
famous battle of Fei-pi (the ripe plantains). The
field of battle was among the foothills near the
coast. Opuhara's warriors made a valiant attack
and pierced the front ranks of the enemy till it
reached the spot where one of the queens, Pomare
vehine, and the chief warriors stood. There one
of the native converts leveled his gun at Opuhara,
fired, the chief fell, and in a very short time
expired. The leader of the native forces was
killed by one of his own people who had cast
his lot with Pomare and the missionaries.</p>
<p>This war was brought on to force the natives
to Pomare's rule, and not for the purpose of
removing obstacles to the Christianization of the
islanders, as the chiefs were not opposed to the
peaceable dissemination of the teachings of the
gospel. It was a political and not a religious war,
and in this political endeavor the missionaries
and their converts took the leading part. The
missionaries evidently forgot the legitimate
object of their mission and unmercifully
slaughtered the natives who took up arms to defend
their rights. The Christians on Pomare's side
were fighting for supremacy, unmindful of the
teachings of the sacred Scriptures.</p>
<blockquote>
For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath
showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against
judgment St. James ii: 13.</blockquote>
<p>When Opuhara fell, his men lost courage,
retreated, and were not pursued. The death of
Opuhara was deeply regretted by Tati, his near
relative and successor in the government of the
district. In the ranks of his followers it was
firmly believed Opuhara, few as his forces were,
would have vanquished the enemy, had not the
native missionaries been taught to shoot as they
were taught to pray, and been supplied with guns
along with Bibles. With the death of Opuhara
the last hope of the natives was dissipated and
submission to Pomare's rule became a stern
reality. Neither the missionaries nor the natives
had any idea of allowing Pomare to recede into
his old ways. They made him refrain from
massacre or revenge after the battle of Fei-pi. Tati,
the chief of Papara, maintained peace from that
time by his wise rule in that part of the island.
He began by the usual island custom of binding
Pomare to him by the strongest possible ties.
The rapid extinction of chiefly families in Tahiti
had left the head chief of Moorea heir to most of
the distinguished names and properties in both
islands. Marama, the head chief of Moorea, had
only one heir, a daughter, a relative of Pomare.
This great heiress, almost the last remnant of
the three or four sacred families of the two
islands, was given by Pomare in marriage to
Tati's son, immediately after Tati himself was
restored to his rights as head chief of the Tevas.
In doing so he claimed for his own the first child
that Marama (the bride) should have and made
at the same time a compact that the children
from the marriage should marry into the Pomare
family. These conditions were made to render
himself more influential with the most refractory
of the conquered tribes. Pomare II. died
December 7, 1821, leaving a daughter, Aimata, and
a son, Pomare III., a child in arms. Aimata was
never regarded with favor by Pomare, her father,
who was frank in saying that she was not his
child; so the infant son was made heir to the
throne. Moerenhout made the statement that
Pomare, on his deathbed, expressed the wish that
Tati should take the reins of the government in
his hands, but that the missionaries and other
chiefs were afraid to trust Tati, and preferred to
take the charge of the infant king on themselves.
The missionaries in due time went through the
formal ceremony of crowning the infant, April
22, 1824, at Papara, and then took him to their
school, the South Sea Academy, which was
established in March, 1824, in the island of Moorea at
Papetoai. There he was taught to read and
write, and educated in English, which became his
language, until he was seven years old, when he
fell ill, and was taken over to his mother at Pare,
where he died January 11, 1827. During the
reign of the infant king, Mata, a friend of the
family, managed the affairs of state and became
the guardian of Aimata, as the Queen, Pomare
IV., was always called by the natives. Aimata
was married at the age of nine years. She led an
unhappy life, domestic, political, private and
public, until at last the missionaries, English and
French, fought so violently for control of her and
the island that she was actually driven away.</p>
<p>Among other laws which were supposed to
have been passed through the influence of the
English missionaries, to prevent strangers from
obtaining influence in the island, was one dated
March 1, 1833, forbidding strangers, under any
pretext, from marrying in Tahiti or Moorea.
Ariitaimai, of noble birth, the historian of Tahiti,
was not inclined to marry a native chief, a
decision which met the approval of Marama, her
mother. She finally consented to become the wife
of Mr. Salmon, an Englishman, who was held in
high esteem and consideration in the island; and
Aimata suspended the law in order to enable her
friend to be married to the man of her choice.
The missionaries virtually ruled the island for
forty years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wars-between-protestant-and-catholic-missionaries">
<h1>WARS BETWEEN PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES</h1>
<p>In 1836 two French missionary priests landed
at Tahiti to convert, not pagans, but Protestants
to the Roman Catholic faith. The Protestant
missionaries, who held the reins of the
government, indignant at this interference, invoked the
aid of the British consul, Pritchard, who caused
the Queen to order their arrest and expulsion.
The order was executed December 12, 1836.
The two priests made a protest to their
government, and King Louis Philippe sent a frigate to
Papeete with the usual ultimatum, to which the
Queen naturally acceded. Then began a struggle
on the part of Consul Pritchard and the English
missionaries to recover their ground, which led
to a letter from Queen Pomare to Queen Victoria,
suggesting a British protectorate, whereupon the
French government sent another warship to
Tahiti, in 1839, and made Aimata repeat her
submission. As the British government at that
time did not take much interest in missionaries,
and Sir Robert Peel had a very precise knowledge
of the value of unclaimed islands all over the
world, Queen Victoria did not accept the
proposition made by the Tahitian Queen, and the
missionaries were again thrown on their own
resources.</p>

<p class="caption">TAHITI GIRLS IN NATIVE DRESS</p>
</div>
<p>The chiefs ignored the missionaries, and in
September, 1841, decided that, between such
powers as England and France, they could not
hope to maintain independence or even a good
understanding, and since England refused the
proffered protectorate, they would turn to
France. So they drew up the necessary papers
for the Queen to approve, but a British war
vessel arrived in that critical moment, and this
reenforcement of British interests induced the
vacillating Queen to refuse to sign them. The next
August another French naval force arrived, and
the chiefs again met in council, with the admiral's
aid and advice. The chiefs sent the following
letter to the French admiral, Du Petit—Tuhouars:</p>
<blockquote>
Inasmuch as we can not continue to govern ourselves
so as to live on good terms with foreign governments,
and we are in danger of losing our island, our kingdom,
and our liberty, we, the Queen and the high chiefs of
Tahiti, write to ask the King of the French to take us
under his protection.</blockquote>
<p>In response to this formal request the French
admiral, on September 30, 1842, hoisted the flag
of the protectorate. This did not end the
political and religious troubles of the little island.
Consul Pritchard, who had been absent from his
post for some time, returned from England
February 23, 1843, and declared violent war against
the French. As usual, Queen Pomare yielded to
his wishes, and refused to obey those of the
French admiral. The admiral lost his patience
and temper, landed troops and took possession
of the island, declared the Queen deposed, and,
when disturbances arose, which he believed to be
fomented and fostered by Pritchard, he arrested
him and had him expelled from the island. This
act excited much attention, both in the English
and French press, which resulted in an order
from the King of France to the admiral to restore
the protectorate.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the last wars of Tahiti
were caused by a religious intolerance on the part
of the English missionaries, who objected to the
presence of two Roman Catholic priests in the
island. European governments were appealed
to and had to interfere in establishing in the
island free religious thought. It was a fight
between two religious denominations which kept
the natives in a state of warfare, a most serious
reflection on Christian charity,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alas for the rarity</p>
<p>Of Christian charity</p>
<p>Under the sun.</p>
<p>HOOD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The constant unrest of the islanders caused
by outside interference provoked frequent
rebellions, for &quot;general rebellions and revolts of an
whole people never were encouraged, now or at
any time; they are always provoked.&quot;</p>
<p>The two priests, bent upon a humane mission,
who, by their presence in Tahiti, without any
fault of their own, incurred the enmity of the
Protestant missionaries, were the direct cause of
French intervention which resulted in the
protectorate and later annexation of the island.
The priests remained, new ones came, and
today nearly one-half of the population of the island
are members of the Roman Catholic church.</p>
<p>The teachings and example of the English
missionaries and their conduct toward the Catholic
priests prove only too plainly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christian graces and virtues they can not be, unless
fed, invigorated and animated by universal charity.</p>
<p>ATTERBURY.</p>

<h1>THE LAST WAR</h1>

<p>Our country sinks beneath the yoke;</p>
<p>It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash</p>
<p>Is added to her wounds.</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The disturbances which preceded and followed
the establishment of the French protectorate
induced the Queen to seek safety on a British ship,
and the whole Pomare following took up arms
and established themselves in the stronghold of
native power and influence near Papeete. Another
civil war broke out which waged between the
natives and Europeans from 1844 to 1845. Tired
of foreign dictation and oppression, the natives
fought with desperation. Forts, which remain
today in a good state of preservation, were erected
by natives and the French. Most of the ruins
of these forts are scattered along the ninety-mile
drive between Papeete and Papara. From time
to time, determined attacks were made with
varying fortunes of war. The natives were superior
in number but could not stand up against the
well-directed firearms of the professional soldiers.
A last and crushing attack was ordered by the
French admiral, which meant certain defeat for
the natives.</p>
<p>It was at this critical time that a woman came
to the rescue of her people and prevented a
wholesale slaughter of the heroic defenders of
the island. This woman was Ariitaimai, the
authoress of the book we have been following so
closely in sketching the history of the island. She
was the daughter of the famous Marama, of
Moorea, the wife of Mr. Salmon, and the mother
of Tati Salmon, the present chief of Papara. She
recognized the hopelessness of the cause of her
people and determined to prevent further useless
bloodshed and establish peace. It required good
judgment and a great deal of courage to
undertake the task which she finally accomplished with
such a brilliant success. She was one of those
who believed that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost all difficulties may be got the better of by
prudent thought, revolving and pondering much in the
mind.</p>
<p>MARCELLINUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was intensely patriotic and had no fear
of the results of her daring mission. She was
very popular with the natives and well known to
the French authorities, which aided her very
much in formulating and carrying out her plans.
She had no time to lose, as the decisive attack
on her countrymen had been ordered and was to
take place the next day. She called on Bruaat,
the governor of the island, with the determined
intention to end the war. He granted her
twenty-four hours to accomplish her task. She then
called a meeting of the head chiefs and urged
them to surrender on the conditions stipulated by
the French, in view of the hopelessness of the
island's cause. At that time this woman was
the most conspicuous figure in the politics of the
island, loved and respected by the chiefs and the
people throughout Tahiti and Moorea. The
head chiefs received her proposition with favor.
Notable speeches complimentary to her were
made on this occasion. One chief said:</p>
<blockquote>
Ariitaimai, you have flown amongst us, as it were,
like the two birds, Ruataa and Toena. Your object was
to join together Urarii and Mauu, and you have brought
them into this valley. You have brought the cooling
medicines of <em>vainu</em> and <em>mahainuieumu</em> into the hearts
of the chiefs that are collected here. Our hearts yearn
for you, and we can not in words thank you; but the
land, one and all, will prove to you in the future that
your visit will always remain in their memory. You
have come personally. I have heard you speak the
words out of your own mouth. You have brought us
the best of all goods, which is peace. You have done
this when you thought we were in great trouble, and
ran the risk of losing our lives and property; you have
come forward as a peacemaker for us all.</blockquote>
<p>What beautiful thoughts in simple, homely
language! What a splendid specimen of natural
oratory!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In oratory, affectation must be avoided; it being
better for a man by a native and clear eloquence to
express himself than by those words which may smell
either of the lamp or ink-horn.</p>
<p>LORD HERBERT OF CHERBURY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chiefs unanimously accepted the terms
of peace, and after the adjournment of the
council, Ariitaimai hastened to Papeete with the
message of the chiefs, which was accepted, and
once more the protectorate flag was raised
and was recognized and respected by the chiefs
and the people. During all these great final
trials of the island, the Queen remained in the
island of Moorea and even after peace was
restored and she was formally requested to
return, she refused to do so. The French
authorities offered the crown repeatedly to Ariitaimai,
but as often, she refused the great honor. The
exiled Queen was her intimate and dear friend
and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ennuis has well remarked that &quot;a real friend is
known in adversity.&quot;</p>
<p>CICERO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was content with having accomplished a
patriotic deed and with the respect, love and
gratitude of her people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So true it is, that honor, prudently declined, often
comes back with increased lustre.</p>
<p>LIVIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She could say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me a staff of honour for mine age;</p>
<p>But not a sceptre to control the world.</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tis less to conquer than to make wars cease,</p>
<p>And, without fighting, awe the world to peace.</p>
<p>HALIFAX.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ariitaimai made several visits to the unhappy
Queen, urging her to return and resume her
reign of the island, and had the satisfaction,
finally, to bring her back from Raiatea on her
third visit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True friends visit us in prosperity only when invited,
but in adversity they come without invitation.</p>
<p>THEOPHRASTUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Queen, on her return, was received with
regal honors by the French authorities and by
the people.</p>
<p>Pomare V. was the last of the kings of Tahiti.
He was the oldest son of Queen Pomare IV. and
known as Ariiane Pomare. He was married to
Marau Taawa Salmon, Tati Salmon's sister, and
had two daughters: Teriimii-o-Tahiti, and
Arii mainhinihi. Under European influences and
customs he became a degenerate Tahitian,
profligate and dissipated, and it is said that he was
largely responsible for the annexation of the
island to France as a colony in 1880, as he
received a substantial remuneration for his
influence in that direction and a pension of sixty
thousand francs a year. He died in 1891. Since
Tahiti has become a French possession the island
has enjoyed uninterrupted peace. The French
government has been exceedingly liberal with the
natives, having interfered as little as possible
with their habits and customs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is the best government which desires to make
the people happy, and knows how to make them happy.</p>
<p>MACAULEY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The island is governed under the French laws,
but local laws and tribal rule remain and
administer the local affairs. In completing the eventful
history of this little island it becomes apparent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is public history but a register of the successes
and disappointments, the vices, the follies and quarrels
of those engaged in the contention for power.</p>
<p>PALEY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The government has established and enforced
religious liberty, observing the precept: &quot;The
protection of religion is indispensable to all
government&quot; (Bishop Warburton). Taxation is
limited to road tax only. The annexation was
looked upon with great disfavor by the natives,
but was finally accepted with good grace, and
peace and happiness have reigned since.</p>

<h1>THE NATIVES</h1>
<p>The Polynesians inhabiting the islands of the
great Pacific Ocean constitute a distinct race of
people, supposed at one time by certain writers
to be of American origin, now almost
universally admitted to have a close affinity with the
Malays of the peninsula and Indian Archipelago,
and hence classified by Dr. Latham under his
subdivision <em>Oceanica Mongolidæ</em>. In physical
structure and appearance the Polynesians in
general more nearly resemble the Malays than they
do any other race, although differing from them
in some respects, as, indeed, the natives of several
of the groups also do from each other. Centuries
and environment have left their impress on the
inhabitants of the different islands, as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything that is created is changed by the laws
of man; the earth does not know itself in the revolution
of years; even the races of man assume various forms
in the course of years.</p>
<p>MANILIUS.</p>

<p class="caption">NATIVE GIRL IN MODERN DRESS</p>
</div>
<p>In stature the Tahitian compares well with any
other race. The face is expressive of more than
ordinary intelligence. The color of the skin
varies from almost black to a light yellow. The
aquiline nose is commonly seen among them, and
there are many varieties of hair and complexion.
In complexion they resemble more nearly the
Japanese than the Chinese. The beard is thin,
the prevailing hair jet black, straight, wavy or
curly, profuse and long; eyes large and black; no
drooping or obliquity of eyelids. The face is
generally roundish; lower jaw well developed;
no unusual malar prominences; forehead slightly
receding; mouth large, lips thick and as a rule
slightly everted; wide nostrils; ears large; chin
prominent. The general resemblance of stature
and physiognomy, however, is more with the
Malays than any other race, and from which they
are undoubtedly the descendants, changed by
climatic influences, food, habits and methods of
living. In physical appearance the Tahitians and
Samoans are the handsomest and tallest of all
the natives of the Pacific Islands, with the
exception, perhaps, of the Maoris, or New
Zealanders.</p>
<p>The superstition of the taboo, the use of kava
as an intoxicating drink, cannibalism, infanticide,
offering of human sacrifices, tattooing, and
circumcision, which were formerly prevalent in
Tahiti, have disappeared under the influence of
Christianity.</p>
<p>Much has been said about the beauty of some
of the women of the South Sea Islands, but I
am sure I do them no injustice if I say that these
descriptions are overdrawn by sentimental writers
and do not correspond, when put to the test of
comparison, with the reality. When young, there
is something fascinating about the women,
imparted by the luxurious jet-black hair, the large
black eyes as they gaze at the strangers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a smile that is childlike and bland.</p>
<p>FRANCIS BRET HARTE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beauty and youth among the Tahitian women
are of short duration, and in most of them
advanced age brings an undesirable degree of
corpulence.</p>
<p>Cook visited these people when they were in
their original physical and moral state. He
praises their openness and generosity. &quot;Neither
does care ever seem to wrinkle their brow. On the
contrary, even the approach of death does not
appear to alter their usual vivacity. I have seen
them, when brought to the brink of the grave by
disease, and when preparing to go to battle; but in
neither case, never observed their countenance
overclouded with melancholy, or serious
reflection. Such a disposition leads them to direct
all their aims only to what can give them pleasure
and ease.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole countenance is a certain silent language
of the mind.</p>
<p>CICERO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These mental traits have been preserved up to
the present time. Melancholy and suicide are
almost unknown in Tahiti. The people are
happy, contented and free from care and anxiety
and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enjoy the pleasures of the passing hour, and bid
adieu for a time to grave pursuits.</p>
<p>HORATIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They seem to know that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Care and the desire for more</p>
<p>Attend the still increasing store.</p>
<p>HORATIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Desire for great wealth does not exist among
the natives. Nature has supplied them with
nearly all they need, hence little remains for
them to do to meet their modest desires.</p>
<p>Religion has not done away entirely with
superstition, and has improved their morals little, if
any. Old European residents of Papeete agree
that the morality of the natives has not improved
since they have been under the influence of
civilization, forced on them by the European
invaders. The greatest fault of the people is
their incurable laziness, a vice for which they
are not entirely responsible, as Nature has
provided so bountifully for their needs. Robbery,
stealing and murder are almost unknown; petty
thefts, on the contrary, are quite common. The
people, young and old, are affable, extremely
courteous and hospitable to a fault; the family
ties strong, and extending to the remotest
relatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man is a social animal, and born to live together so
as to regard the world as one house.</p>
<p>SENECA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowhere in the world are the people more
sociable than in Tahiti. This sociability was
perhaps more pronounced before the island was
discovered than it is now, but it remains to this
day as one of the prominent characteristics of
the Polynesian race. Respect and love for
parents, strong attachments to relatives and friends,
are striking virtues of the Tahitians. They love
social intercourse and have the highest regard
for friendship. Poverty and misfortunes do not
intercept friendships, on the contrary they
cement them more firmly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The firmest friendships have been formed in mutual
adversity; as iron is most strongly united by the
fiercest flames.</p>
<p>COLTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before European influence had made itself felt
in the island, each tribe constituted a large
family, and property lines were not sharply defined.
As long as there was anything to eat, no one
was left hungry. The Tahitians are extremely
fond of mingling with their relatives, friends,
members of the same and other tribes. They
appreciate to the fullest extent that &quot;we have
been born to unite with fellow-men, and to join
in community with the human race&quot; (Cicero).
They treat old age with reverence and respect,
and take the very best care of the sick and poor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unity of feelings and affections is the strongest
relationship.</p>
<p>PUBLIUS SYRUS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="caption">TAHITIAN LADIES IN ZULU DRESS</p>
</div>
<p>Under the teachings of the missionaries,
Protestant and Catholic, paganism has
disappeared from the island. All are church-members
and attend service regularly. The
denominations represented are the Episcopalians,
Catholics and Latter-day Saints in above numerical
order. Most of the priests and preachers are
natives. Christianity, has, however, failed to
suppress immorality and do away entirely with
the inborn superstition of the natives. The
former evil is firmly rooted, the latter difficult of
complete eradication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing has more power over the multitude than
superstition: in other respects powerless, ferocious,
fickle, when it is once captivated by superstitious
notions, it obeys its priests better than its leaders.</p>
<p>QUINTUS CURTIUS RUFUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wicked habits are productive of vice, and vice
follows long-standing habits. The Tahitians are
by nature kind, affectionate, and their opinions
are easily moulded for good or bad, but many of
their customs and habits cling to them in spite of
civilization and Christianization, for &quot;how many
unjust and wicked things are done from mere
habit!&quot; (Terentius); and &quot;so much power has
custom over tender minds&quot; (Virgilius).</p>
<p>The children of Tahiti are given excellent
opportunities for obtaining a good elementary
education. In all of the larger villages there is
a government school, usually two churches.
Catholic and Protestant, and their respective
parochial schools. The natives love their
language and are averse to the French, hence, as a
rule, the parochial are better patronized than the
government schools. The literature in the
Tahitian language is limited to translations of
the Bible, catechisms, religious song books and a
few school books. Children of the better classes
who seek a higher education, go abroad, in
preference to the United States. Few show any
ambition to enter any of the professions with the
exception of the clerical. The mass of the people
are content in leading an easy, dreamy life,
showing no disposition either to acquire wealth
or fame. Agriculture, manufacture and
commerce have no attraction for them. They are
children from the cradle to the grave, have the
desires of children, and are pleased with what
pleases children. Their tastes are simple, their
desires few, and instead of in care and worry,
they live through their span of life in peace of
mind and contentment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if men would live according to reason's rules,
they would find the greatest riches to live content with
little, for there is never want where the mind is
satisfied.</p>
<p>LUCRETIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the Westerner, the favored
Tahitian can say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have everything, yet have nothing; and although I
possess nothing, still of nothing am I in want.</p>
<p>TERRENCE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The natives are temperate in drinking, and
frugal in eating. Fish and fruit are their
principal articles of diet. Their habits in this
direction have not undergone much change since
Captain Cook wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
Their common diet is made up of at least
nine-tenths vegetable food; and, I believe, more particularly,
the <em>mahee</em>, or fermented breadfruit, which enters
almost every meal, has a remarkable effect upon them,
preventing a costive habit, and producing a very
sensible coolness about them, which could not be
perceived in us who fed on animal food. And it is,
perhaps, owing to this temperate course of life that
they have so few diseases among them.</blockquote>
<p>Smoking is indulged in only to a moderate
extent, cigarettes and pipe being the favorite
methods of consuming the weed.</p>
<p>Art has never had a place in the minds of
the Tahitians. All attempts in this direction in
design, carving and sculpture, are rude. Like
all primitive peoples, they are fond of music.
Their voices are sweet, but the airs of their
music are monotonous. The primitive drum, and
a little crude instrument made of bamboo,
something like a flute, placed in one of the nostrils
when played, are the instruments in most
common use. The national dance, formerly the
principal amusement of the people, is discouraged
by the government, but is allowed once a year
as a special favor to the natives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="foreigners-in-tahiti">
<h1>FOREIGNERS IN TAHITI</h1>
<p>Most of the foreigners who remain
permanently in Tahiti become attached to the island
by marriage, the strongest possible incentive to
make it their permanent home. Many of these
men are adventurers. Some of them have honest
intentions to make this beautiful island their
permanent home. Far away from their place of
birth and relatives, charmed by the beauties of
the island, they conclude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will take some savage woman; she shall rear my
dusky race.</p>
<p>TENNYSON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many instances such unions have resulted
very happily. On the voyage from San
Francisco to Tahiti, I met Mr. George R. Richardson,
a native of Springfield, Mass., who had lived for
the last thirty years, with his native wife on the
little atoll island, Kaukuaia of the Tuamotu group,
one hundred and sixty-eight miles from Tahiti.
He was suffering from carcinoma of the
esophagus, and was returning from San
Francisco, whither he had gone for medical advice.
His parents were still living, but he had no
desire to visit the place of his birth, so fully had
he become acclimated to the climatic and native
conditions of the Society Islands. He was then
fifty-five years of age. He left the United States
March 4, 1874, on a sailing vessel, and six months
later landed at Tahxa. In six months he had
obtained a fair knowledge of the native language,
and married in Kaukuaia a woman who could not
speak a word of English. This union resulted in
sixteen children, three of whom died, six girls
and seven boys living at the present time, and of
these, three girls and two boys are married.
Through his wife he inherited from her mother
five acres of land with three thousand
cocoanut-palms. To this land he obtained a legal
ownership eight years ago by virtue of a law of legal
registration passed by the government. The
island on which he lives contains only one
hundred and fifty inhabitants and the only income is
obtained from copra and mother-of-pearl.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="image23">
<img alt="NATIVE MUSICIANS" src="images/Image23.jpg" style="width: 600.0px; height: 426.0px;" />
<p class="caption">NATIVE MUSICIANS AND NATIVE DANCE</p>
</div>
<p>The inhabitants of this island are Catholics and
Mormons. A Catholic priest comes once a month
to minister to the spiritual needs of the
adherents to the faith of his church. The services of
both denominations are conducted in the native
language. He and a Frenchman are the only
white inhabitants of the island.</p>
<p>On February 16, 1878, a great storm
overflooded the island and our American, who spent
a whole night in the crown of a cocoanut tree,
lost everything. Only five thousand cocoanut
trees were left on the whole island. A
man-of-war came from Tahiti three days later and
ministered to the urgent needs of the survivors.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this little island suffer
frequently from malaria and grippe. The
latter disease returns regularly almost every
year. Of the remaining diseases, diarrhea
and dysentery are the most common.
Tuberculosis is prevalent and claims many victims.
This island has now a population of one
hundred and fifty, and during his residence he
has never seen a physician, although the
inhabitants were frequently in need of medical
services. He was obliged to render his wife
assistance at the birth of all of his children, and
strangely, each time without any mishap, either
to mother or child. What happened on that
island must have happened on the many other
distant islands under similar circumstances. Here,
like elsewhere, in the South Sea Islands, are
medicine-men who attend to tooth-pulling, and,
when any cutting is to be done, a scalpel is made
of a piece of glass. In case of sickness they make
use of roots and herbs of their own gathering.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="business-in-tahiti">
<h1>BUSINESS IN TAHITI</h1>
<p>The Tahitian is not a business man. What little
business is transacted in the island is done by
foreigners. The larger stores in Papeete are
owned and managed by French, Germans and
Americans. The smaller stores in the city, and
nearly all small shops in the villages, are in the
hands of Chinamen.</p>
<p>The fertile soil of Tahiti is not made use of to
any considerable extent. The sugar industry has
been tried but has been entirely abandoned, owing
to high wages for labor and exorbitant freight
rates. The principal articles of export are copra,
cocoanuts, vanilla-beans and mother-of-pearl
shells. Copra (dried meat of cocoanut), brings
three cents a kilo and cocoanuts are sold at a
cent apiece. The raising of vanilla-beans was a
paying industry five years ago, when they
commanded a price of seventeen dollars a pound, and
were then eagerly sought for in the market, as
they were considered superior in flavor to those
of any other country. The Chinamen have ruined
this source of income as well as the reputation of
the product. These shrewd business men control
the local market completely and go from place
to place long before harvest-time, buy the whole
crop for the year for cash, and have the beans
picked before they are ripe and mature them
artificially. The result of such dishonest
transactions has been that, owing to the poor quality
of the beans thus treated, the price of the article
has been reduced to three or four dollars per
pound.</p>
<p>The vanilla-bean grows best in the shady
forests, and requires but little attention except
artificial fertilization of the flowers and picking
of the beans. In the West Indies the numerous
insects fertilize the monogamous flowers; in this
island, this has to be done largely by artificial
fecundation. Women and children do this work.
With a sharp little stick, the pollen is taken from
the anthers and rubbed over the stigma of the
pistil. A child who is active can fertilize fifteen
hundred flowers a day. It is a great pity that
this industry has been cheapened by the
avaricious Chinamen, as it is an industry that requires
very little labor and should be remunerative, as
the soil and climate are peculiarly well adapted
for the cultivation of this valuable aromatic.</p>
<p>Most of the fruit which grows in Tahiti is too
perishable for transportation and is consequently
very cheap. The largest and most luscious
pineapples can be bought for three cents apiece,
oranges one-fourth of a cent. Alligator pears,
the finest fruit grown anywhere, are sold at the
market for two and three cents apiece. At the
time of my visit, eggs were sold at forty cents a
dozen. Meat, with the exception of pork, is
imported from New Zealand and the United States.
Most of the native families raise hogs, and this
animal is found also in a wild state in the jungles
of the forests.</p>
<p>The wages, for this island, are rather high. An
ordinary laborer is paid seventy-five cents a
day, and the women who are willing to work can
earn fifty cents a day. The average Tahitian
works only long enough to procure the
necessities of life, and, as these are few, it is difficult
to find men and women for ordinary labor and
housework.</p>
<p>The fact that there is no bank in the whole
island shows that the amount of money which
circulates among the people is very small. Some
enterprising American attempted to establish a
telephone line encircling the island, but lack of
patronage soon paralyzed the undertaking. The
island is a place for a dreamy, easy existence, and
not for business.</p>
<p>The communication with the outside world is
carried on by two regular steamer lines, one
from San Francisco, the other from Auckland,
but both of these lines are supported by liberal
government subsidies to make them remunerative,
as the passenger traffic and the exports and
imports of the island would not suffice to make them
independent of government aid.</p>

<p>Tahiti is exceedingly interesting to-day, but
how much more so must it have been to Captain
Wallis and his crew, who first set their eyes on
this gem of the Pacific! When the <em>Dolphin</em>
came in sight of this beautiful island that never
before had been seen by a white man, we can
readily imagine officers and crew straining their
eyes to see first its rugged outlines, and later the
details of the wonderful landscapes. Under the
blue sky and lighted up by the vigorous rays of
the tropic sun, they could see the mountain-peaks
clothed in the verdure of a tropic forest, the
little island set like a gem in the ocean, and, as
they beheld these mountains and turned their
eyes upward they could also see</p>

<p>They were canopied by the blue sky, so cloudless,
clear, and purely beautiful that God alone was to be

</div>
<p>As they approached nearer and saw the natural
wealth of the island and its happy inhabitants
basking in the sunshine, eating what Nature had
provided for them without care or toil on their
part, they must have come to the unavoidable
conclusion that they at last had found a land
where</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a never-ending spring, and flowers unsown
were kissed by the warm western breeze. Then the
unploughed land gave forth corn, and the ground, year
after year, was white with full ears of grain. Rivers
of milk, rivers of nectar ran, and the yellow honey
continued to pour from the ever-green oak.</p>
<p>OVIDIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On landing, having overcome the animosity of
the natives and ascertained the boundless
resources of the island, they could not escape
the conviction that they in their wanderings
over the limitless sea, had at last found &quot;a heaven
on earth&quot; (Milton).</p>
<p>What wonderful stories those men must have
brought to Europe on their return after the long
and hazardous voyage, when they related what
they had seen in Tahiti, then in its primitive
native state! Captain Cook made a longer stay
in the island on his first visit and had therefore
a better opportunity to study the island, its
resources and its interesting inhabitants. It is on
his descriptions we will rely in giving an account
of some of the traits, customs and habits of the
people as they existed at that time.</p>

<div class="section" id="religion-of-the-natives">
<h1>RELIGION OF THE NATIVES</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Every one is, in a small degree, the image of God.</p>
<p>MANLIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most primitive of all races have some
conception of a divinity and a life hereafter, for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A god has his abode within our breast; when he
rouses us, the glow of inspiration warms us; this
holy rapture springs from the seeds of the divine mind
sown in man.</p>
<p>OVIDIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us listen to Captain Cook concerning the
religion of the Tahitians before they knew the
name of God and the story of the Saviour while
on earth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The common people have only a very vague idea of
the religious sentiments of the race, but the priests,
who are quite numerous, have established quite an
extensive and somewhat complicated system. They
do not worship one God, as possessing preeminence;
but believe in a plurality of divinities, who are all
supposed to be very powerful, and, as different parts
of the island, and the other islands in the
neighborhood, have different ones, the inhabitants of such,
no doubt, think that they have chosen the most potent
and considerate one. Their devotion in serving their
gods is remarkably conspicuous. Not only the whattas
or offering-places of the morals are commonly loaded
with fruits and animals, but there are few houses
lacking a small place of the same sort. Many of them
are so impressed with their obligations to their divinity
that they will not begin a meal without first laying
aside a morsel for their Eatooa (their god).</p>
<p>Their prayers are also very frequent, which they
chant, much after the manner of songs, in their festive
entertainments. They also believe in an evil spirit,
they call Etee, who sometimes does them mischief,
and to whom, as well as to their god, they make
offerings.</p>
<p>But the mischiefs they fear from any superior
invisible beings are confined only to temporal things. They
believe the soul to be both immaterial and immortal.
They say that it keeps fluttering about the lips
during the pangs of death, and that then it ascends and
mixes with, or, as they express it, is eaten by the
deity. In this state it remains for some time; after
which it departs to a certain place destined for the
reception of the souls of men, where it exists in eternal
night, or, as they sometimes say, in twilight or dawn.
They have no idea of any permanent punishment after
death for crimes that they have committed on earth.
They believe in the recognition of relatives and friends
after death and in resuming the same relations as on
earth. If the husband dies first, the soul of his wife is
known to him on its arrival in the land of spirits. They
resume their former acquaintance, in a spacious house,
where the souls of the deceased assemble to recreate
themselves with the gods. From here man and wife
retire to their own habitation, where they remain
forever.</p>
<p>The most singular part of their faith consists in
claiming that not only man, but all other animals, trees,
fruit and even stones are endowed with a soul, which
at death, or upon being consumed or broken, ascends
to the divinity, with whom they first mix, and
afterward pass into the mansion allotted to each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The temples of the Tahitians were the maraes,
enclosures of stones, where the offerings were
rendered, and on certain occasions human beings
were sacrificed. The largest marae ever built in
Tahiti is located at Papara and the ruins of
it remain to-day. At the time of Captain
Cook's visit there were numerous maraes all over
the island, which served as places of worship,
sacrifice and burial. The supreme chief of the
whole island was always housed in a marae and
after his death the marae was appropriated to
his family and some of the principal people. Such
a marae differed little from the common ones,
except in extent. Its principal part is a large,
oblong pile of stones, lying loosely upon each
other, about twelve or fourteen feet high,
contracted towards the top, with a square area on
each side, loosely packed with pebble stones,
under which the bones of the chiefs are buried.
At a little distance from the end nearest the sea is
the place where the sacrifices are offered, which,
for a considerable extent, is also loosely paved.
There is here a very large scaffold, or whatta, on
which the offerings, and other vegetables, are
laid. But the animals are deposited on a smaller
one, already mentioned, and the human
sacrifices are buried under different parts of the
pavement. The marae is the altar of other nations.
The skulls of the human sacrifices, after a few
months, are exhumed and preserved in the marae.</p>
<p>Captain Cook counted forty-nine such skulls in
the marae in which he witnessed the human
sacrifice.</p>

</div>
<p>Cannibalism did not exist in Tahiti when the
island was discovered, but human sacrifices were
quite frequently offered as a kind of religious
ceremony to appease the anger or displeasure of
some offended god. The victims were tramps
and persons of no vocation. They were either
clubbed or stoned to death by persons designated
for this purpose by the priests. On Saturday,
August 30, 1777, while Captain Cook was
stationed at Matavai for the purpose of observing
the transit of Venus, he received a message that
on the following day a human sacrifice would be
made at Attahura, to Eatooa, to implore the
assistance of the deity against the inhabitants of
the island of Moorea, who were then in a state
of war with Tahiti. Towha, a chief and relative
of the then reigning king, had killed a man for
the sacrifice. Captain Cook, with several friends,
accompanied King Otoo to witness the ceremony,
and describes the event in detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On our way we landed upon a little island, which
lies off Tettaha, where we found Towha and his retinue.
After some little conversation between the two chiefs,
on the subject of the war, Towha addressed himself
to me, asking my assistance. When I excused myself,
he seemed angry; thinking it strange I, who had always
declared myself to be the friend of their island, should
not go and fight against its enemies. Before we parted
he gave to Otoo two or three red feathers, tied up in
a tuft; and a lean, half-starved dog was put in a canoe
that was to accompany us. We then embarked again,
taking on board a priest who was to assist at the
solemnity. As soon as we landed at Attahura, which
was about two o'clock in the afternoon, Otoo expressed
his desire that the seamen might be ordered to remain
in the boat, and that Mr. Anderson, Mr. Webber and
myself might take off our hats as soon as we should
come to the marai, to which we immediately proceeded,
attended by a great many men, and some boys, but not
one woman. We found four priests and their
attendants, or assistants, waiting for us.</p>
<p>The dead body, or sacrifice, was in a small canoe
that lay on the beach and partly in the water of the
sea, fronting the marai. Two of the priests, with
some of the attendants, were sitting by the canoe, the
others at the marai. Our company stopped about
twenty or thirty paces from the priests. Here Otoo
placed himself; we, and a few others standing by him,
while the bulk of the people remained at a greater
distance. The ceremony now began. One of the
priest's attendants brought a young plantain tree, and
laid it down before Otoo. Another approached with
a small tuft of red feathers, twisted on some fibres of
the cocoanut husk, with which he touched one of the
King's, feet and then retired with it to his companions.
One of the priests, seated at the marai, facing those
who were upon the beach, now began a long prayer;
and, at certain times, sent down young plantain trees,
which were laid upon the sacrifice. During this prayer,
a man, who stood by the officiating priest, held in his
hands two bundles, seemingly of cloth. One of them, as
we afterward found, was the royal Maro; and the
other, if I may be allowed the expression, was the
ark of the Eatooa. As soon as the prayer was ended,
the priests at the marai, with their attendants, went
and sat down by those upon the beach, carrying with
them the two bundles. Here they renewed their
prayers, during which the plantain trees were taken,
one by one, at different times, from off the sacrifice,
which was partly wrapped up in cocoa-leaves and small
branches.</p>
<p>It was now taken out of the canoe and laid upon
the beach, with the feet to the sea. The priests placed
themselves around it, some sitting and others standing;
and one, or more of them, repeated sentences for about
ten minutes. The dead body was now uncovered,
by removing the leaves and branches, and laid in a
parallel direction with the seashore. One of the priests
then, standing at the feet of it, pronounced a long
prayer, in which he was, at times, joined by the others,
each holding in his hand a tuft of red feathers. In
the course of this prayer, some hair was pulled off the
head of the sacrifice, and the left eye taken out; both
of which were presented to Otoo, and wrapped up in
a green leaf. He did not, however, touch it; but gave,
to the man who presented it, the tuft of feathers, which
he had received from Towha. This, with the hair and
the eye, was carried back to the priests. Soon after,
Otoo sent to them another piece of feathers, which he
had given me in the morning to keep in my pocket.
During some part of this last ceremony, a kingfisher
making a noise in the trees, Otoo turned to me saying,
&quot;That is the Eatooa;&quot; and seemed to look upon it to
be a good omen.</p>
<p>The body was then carried a little way, with its head
toward the marai, and laid under a tree, near which
were fixed three broad, thin pieces of wood, differently
but rudely carved. The bundles of cloth were laid on
a part of the marai, and the tufts of red feathers were
placed at the feet of the sacrifice, round which the
priests took their stations, and we were now allowed
to go as near as we pleased. He seemed to be the
chief priest who sat at a small distance, and spoke for
a quarter of an hour, but with different tones and
gestures; so that he seemed often to expostulate with
the dead person, to whom he constantly addressed
himself, and sometimes asked several questions, seemingly
with respect to the propriety of his having been
killed. At other times, he made several demands, as
if the deceased either now had power himself, or
interest with the divinity, to engage him to comply
with such requests. Among the petitions we understood,
he asked him to deliver Eimeo (Moorea), Maheine its
chief, the hogs, women and other things of the island
into their hands; which was, indeed, the express
intention of the sacrifice. He then chanted a prayer, which
lasted nearly half an hour, in whining, melancholy tone,
accompanied by two other priests, and in which Potatou
and some others joined. In the course of this prayer,
some more hair was plucked by a priest from the head
of the corpse, and put upon one of the bundles. After
this, the chief priest prayed alone, holding in his hand
the feathers which came from Towha. When he had
finished, he gave them to another, who prayed in like
manner. Then all the tufts of the feathers were laid
upon the bundles of cloth, which closed the ceremony
at this place.</p>
<p>The corpse was then carried up to the most
conspicuous part of the marai, with the feathers, the two
bundles of cloth, and the drums, the last of which beat
slowly. The feathers and bundles were laid against
the pile of stones, and the corpse at the foot of them.
The priests having again seated themselves round it,
renewed their prayers, while some of their attendants
dug a hole about two feet deep, into which they threw
the unhappy victim, and covered it over with earth and
stones. While they were putting him into the grave,
a boy squeaked aloud and Omai (Captain Cook's
interpreter) said that it was the Eatooa.</p>
<p>The human sacrifice was followed by the offering of
dogs and pigs. The many prayers and complicated
ceremonies attending human sacrifice stamp it as a
religious rite which has undoubtedly been practiced for
centuries. In this particular instance it meant a message
through the instrumentality of the unfortunate victim
to implore Eatooa for assistance in the impending war
with Moorea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very interesting indeed to have an
account of this ceremony preserved by an
eyewitness like Captain Cook, and no apology is
necessary here to have it reappear in all its
minute details. Another religious ceremony of
lesser import is circumcision. How this custom
was introduced into Tahiti no one knows. It is
more than probable that, in some way it came
from the distant Orient in a modified form. It
differs from the Jewish rite in that it is not
performed on infants, but on boys approaching the
age of puberty. Captain Cook gives the
following description of the operation as he observed it:</p>
<blockquote>
When there are five or six lads pretty well grown
up in a neighborhood the father of one of them goes
to a Tahoua, or man of knowledge, and lets him know.
He goes with the lads to the top of the hills, attended
by a servant; and, seating one of them properly,
introduces a piece of wood underneath the foreskin, and
desires him to look aside at something he pretends is
coming. Having thus engaged the young man's
attention to another object, he cuts through the skin upon
the wood, with a shark's tooth, generally at one stroke.
He then separates, or rather turns back, the divided
parts; and, having put on a bandage, proceeds to
perform the same operation on the other lads. At the
end of five days they bathe, and the bandages being
taken off, the matter is cleaned away. At the end of
five days more they bathe again, and are well; but a
thickness of the prepuce, where it was cut, remaining,
they go again to the mountains with the Tahoua and
servant; and a fire being prepared, and some stones
heated, the Tahoua puts the prepuce between two of
them, and squeezes it gently, which removes the
thickness. They then return home, having their heads and
other parts of their bodies, adorned with odoriferous
flowers, and the Tahoua is rewarded for his services
by their fathers, in proportion to their several abilities,
with presents of hogs and cloth; and if they be poor,
their relations are liberal on the occasion.</blockquote>
<p>How the wise man managed to keep the boys
together during two such painful ordeals is not
easy to understand, but as they remained at their
posts until all had passed through it speaks
volumes for their good behavior and manly courage.
That the Tahitians possessed many admirable
virtues during their paganism proves only too
clearly that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtue is shut out from no one; she is open to all,
accepts all, invites all, gentlemen, freedmen, slaves,
kings and exiles; she selects neither house nor fortune;
she is satisfied with a human without adjuncts.</p>
<p>SENECA.</p>

<p class="caption">A HOME BY THE SEA–RAIATEA</p>
</div>
<p>These virtues, the prayers, the sacrifices, the
belief in a supreme being and eternity, show
that the Tahitians were imbued with a natural
religion, for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The existence of God is so many ways manifest and
the obedience we owe Him so congruous to the light
of reason, that a great part of mankind give testimony
to the law of nature.</p>
<p>LOCKE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The natives had no literature nor any
communication with the outside world farther than
the neighboring island groups. Their only book
was nature, and this was read and studied with
eagerness and intelligence. Their ancient history
consisted of legendary lore handed down from
generation to generation. But</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are books extant which they must needs allow
of as proper evidence; even the mighty volumes of
visible nature, and the everlasting tables of right reason.</p>
<p>BENTLEY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From century to century, from generation to
generation, these people, without leaving a
permanent record of what had happened and
without being conscious of art or science, lived
and died in a state of happiness and contentment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For he had no catechism but the creation, needed no
study but recollection, and read no book but the volume
of the world.</p>
<p>SOUTH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That ignorance and vice should have existed
among this primitive people, so completely
isolated from the progressive part of the world, is
not strange, as they lived in a land of plenty, fed
and clothed, as it were, by the almost unaided
resources of nature, conditions largely
responsible for their inborn laziness. Ignorance and
superstition go hand in hand. The Tahitians have
always been extremely superstitious and both
civilization and Christianization have been
powerless in eradicating this national evil. We must,
however, judge them not too severely in this
matter, as superstition is by no means uncommon
amongst us at the present day. Our best poets
are not exempt from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it is the weakness of mine eyes</p>
<p>That shapes this wondrous apparition:</p>
<p>It comes upon me!</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
<p>Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen,
both when we wake and when we sleep.</p>
<p>MILTON.</p>
<p>A person terrified with the imagination of spectres is
more reasonable than one who thinks the appearance
of spirits fabulous and groundless.</p>
<p>ADDISON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the progress and spread of education of
the masses, superstition will gradually be starved
out here as elsewhere. The greatest vice of the
Tahitians is licentiousness, which remains as when
Captain Cook visited the island. In speaking of
the looseness of the marital relations, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
And so agreeable is this licentious plan of life to
their disposition, that the most beautiful of both sexes
thus commonly spend their youthful days, habituated
to the practice of enormities which would disgrace the
most savage tribes, but are peculiarly shocking amongst
a people whose general character in other respects has
evident traces of the prevalence of humane and tender
feelings.</blockquote>
<p>The Tahitians have reason to claim that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vices collected through so many ages for a long
time past flow in upon us.</p>
<p>SENECA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intemperance among the natives has never had
a firm foothold in the island and tobacco is used
with moderation. Gambling, such a common vice
among the peoples of the Orient, has never been
cultivated and practiced to any extent in Tahiti.
These ocean-bound people, living in happy and
contented isolation, had no desire for national or
personal wealth or fame, neither had they any
inclination or desire for art or the sciences. They
believed in the mottoes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are but content, you have enough to live upon
with comfort.</p>
<p>PLAUTUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ambition breaks the ties of blood, and forgets the
obligations of gratitude.</p>
<p>SIR WALTER SCOTT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They lived a restful, unselfish life, happy in the
companionship of their families, relatives and
friends, with no morbid desires to distract them
from the full enjoyment of what Nature showered
upon them with bountiful never-failing liberality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their customs are by Nature wrought;
But we, by art, unteach what Nature taught.</p>
<p>DRYDEN.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="the-insignia-of-tahitian-royalty">
<h1>THE INSIGNIA OF TAHITIAN ROYALTY</h1>
<p>Tahitian royalty was hereditary, and women
were not excluded. There were chiefs and
chiefesses governing tribes, and head chiefs and
head chiefesses ruling over several tribes or the
whole island. There were no crowns and no
sceptres. The insignia of royalty was a belt
ornamented with feathers. The red feathers
were what the diamonds and other precious
stones are in ancient and modern crowns. This
belt was called Maro. Captain Cook gives the
following description of a maro:</p>
<blockquote>
It is a girdle, about five yards long, and fifteen
inches broad; and, from its name, seems to be put on
in the same manner as is the common maro, or piece
of cloth used by these people to wrap round the waist.
It was ornamented with red and yellow feathers; but
mostly with the latter, taken from a dove found upon
the island. The one end was bordered with eight
pieces, each about the size and shape of a horseshoe,
having their edges fringed with black feathers. The
other end was forked, and the points were of different
lengths. The feathers were in square compartments,
ranged in two rows, and otherwise so disposed to
produce a pleasing effect. They had been first pasted
or fixed upon some of their own cloth, and then sewed
to the upper end of the pendant which Captain Wallis
had displayed, and left flying ashore, the first time that
he landed at Matavai.</blockquote>
<p>This insignia of office was highly respected by
the natives and was handed down from one
generation of rulers to the other, carrying with it
the sovereignty of the office. One of the civil
wars in the island was caused by a failure on
the part of one of the chief esses (Purea) to
deliver the maro to her legitimate successor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diseases-of-tahiti">
<h1>DISEASES OF TAHITI</h1>
<p>Before the Europeans came to Tahiti, the
beautiful little island was a sanatorium. The natives
were temperate, frugal in their habits,
subsisting almost exclusively on fish, fruit and
vegetables, and lived practically an outdoor life even
in their bamboo huts. They were
unencumbered by useless clothing and spent, as they do
now, much of their time in sea and fresh-water
bathing. They were almost exempt from acute
destructive diseases. They were free from the
most fatal of acute contagious and infectious
diseases, such as smallpox, measles, scarlatina,
cholera, etc. Tuberculosis and venereal diseases
were unknown before the white man invaded the
island. The immediate effect of the European
civilization on the health and lives of the natives
was frightful. On this subject I will let
Ariitaimai speak:</p>
<blockquote>
When England and France began to show us the
advantages of their civilization, we were, as races then
went, a great people. Hawaii, Tahiti, the Marquesas,
Tonga, Samoa and New Zealand made a respectable
figure on the earth's surface, and contained a population
of no small size, better fitted than any other possible
community for the condition in which they lived. Tahiti,
being the first to come in close contact with the
foreigners, was first to suffer. The people, who numbered,
according to Cook, two hundred thousand in 1767,
numbered less than twenty thousand in 1797, according
to the missionaries, and only about five thousand in
1803. This frightful mortality has been often doubted,
because Europeans have naturally shrunk from
admit    ting the horrors of their own work, but no one doubts
it who belongs to the native race. Tahiti did not
stand alone in misery; what happened there happened
everywhere, not only in the great groups of high islands,
like Hawaii with three or four hundred thousand
people, but in little coral atolls which could only support
a few score.</blockquote>
<div class="figure align-center" id="image27">
<img alt="FISHERMEN'S HOME" src="images/Image27.jpg" style="width: 600.0px; height: 386.0px;" />
<p class="caption">FISHERMEN'S HOME</p>
<div class="legend">
<blockquote>
<p>Moerenhout, who was the most familiar of all
travelers with the islands in our part of the ocean, told the
same story about all. He was in the Austral group
in 1834. At Raivave he found ninety or one hundred
native rapidly dying, where fully twelve hundred had
been living only twelve or fourteen years before. At
Tubuai he found less than two hundred people among
the ruins of houses, temples and tombs. At Rurutu
and Rimitava, where a thousand or twelve hundred
people had occupied each, hardly two hundred were
left, while nearly all the women had been swept away
at Rurutu. Tlie story of the Easter Islanders is
famous. That of the Marquesas is about as pathetic
as that of Tahiti or Hawaii. Everywhere the
Polynesian perished, and to him it mattered little whether he
died of some new disease or from some new weapon,
like the musket, or from misgovernment, caused by the
foreign intervention.</p>
<p>No doubt the new diseases were most fatal. Almost
all of them took some form of fever, and comparatively
harmless epidemics, like measles, became frightfully
fatal when the native, to allay the fever, insisted on
bathing in cold water. Dysentery and ordinary colds,
which the people were too ignorant and too indolent
to nurse, took the proportions of plagues. For forty
generations these people had been isolated in this ocean,
as though they were in a modern sanatorium, protected
from contact with new forms of disease, and living on
vegetables and fish. The virulent diseases which had
been developed among the struggling masses of Asia
and Europe found a rich field for destruction when
they were brought to the South Seas. Just as such
pests as lantana, the mimosa or sensitive plant, and the
guava have overrun many of the islands, where the
field for them was open, so diseases ran through the
people. For this, perhaps, the foreigners were not
wholly responsible, although their civilization certainly
was; but for the political misery the foreigner was
wholly to blame, and for the social and moral
degradation he was the active cause. No doubt the ancient
society of Tahiti had plenty of vices and was a sort
of Paris in its refinements of wickedness, but these
had not prevented the islanders from leading as happy
lives as had ever been known among men.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>These are strong words, but they are
nevertheless only too true. Civilization brings to savage
races curses as well as blessings. The primitive
people are more receptive of new vices than
new virtues.</p>
<p>In 1880 the number of inhabitants had again
increased to thirteen thousand five hundred, but
since that time it has been reduced to eleven
thousand, as shown by the last census. When
Captain Cook visited the island he emphasized
particularly the absence of acute diseases. In
speaking of chronic diseases he remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
They only reckon five or six which might be called
chronic, or national disorders, amongst which are the
dropsy and the <em>fefai</em>, or indolent swellings before
mentioned as frequent at Tongataboo.</blockquote>
<p>The fearful, swift depopulation of the island
was caused by the introduction of new acute
infectious and contagious diseases, such as
smallpox, measles, whooping-cough, la grippe, etc.,
which among these people was attended by a
frightful mortality. It was only three years ago
that an epidemic of measles, a trifling disease
with us, claimed several hundred lives,
including many adults, and extended to nearly all of
the islands of the entire group. The disease that
is now threatening the extinction of the race
in a short time is pulmonary tuberculosis. The
natives are extremely susceptible to this disease,
and the small native houses, crowded with large
families, are the breeding stations for infection.</p>
<p>The French government has at last recognized
the need of taking active measures to improve
the sanitary conditions of their colony and
protect the natives against the spread of infectious
diseases. A corps of three physicians, sent by the
French government on this mission, made the
voyage from San Francisco to the island on the
steamer <em>Mariposa</em> with me. The names of these
physicians are: Dr. Grosfillez, surgeon-major of
the first class of the colonial troops; Dr. H.
Rowan, a graduate of the Pasteur Institute, and
Dr. F. Cassiau, of the clinic of Marseilles. The
military surgeon receives an annual salary of
fifteen hundred dollars, the two civil doctors
twelve hundred dollars each. They are under
contract for five years. They have been given
judicial power to enforce all sanitary regulations
they see fit to institute. They will be stationed at
different points and will establish a requisite
number of lazarettos, something which will fill
a long-felt and pressing need.</p>

<div class="section" id="present-prevailing-diseases">
<h1>PRESENT PREVAILING DISEASES</h1>
<p>The average temperature of the inhabited part
of the island, which can not be less than 78 to
80 degrees Fahrenheit, has a relaxing influence
on the natives and much more so on the small
contingent of whites. The Europeans and
Americans find it necessary every three to five years
to seek for a few months a cooler climate to
restore their energies and vigor. The
government officials and officers of the small garrison
are not obliged to serve for more than the same
time consecutively, when they are relieved from
their posts and commands. It is this relaxation
which, to a certain extent, at least, is responsible
for the great mortality of comparatively mild,
acute, infectious diseases, and the severity of
pulmonary tuberculosis among the natives.
Tuberculosis of the lymphatic glands, skin, bones
and joints appears to be extremely rare. The
moisture-laden atmosphere and the suddenness
with which the cool land and ocean breezes set
in after the heat of the day, are conducive to the
development of rheumatic affections, which are
prevalent in all parts of the island, more
especially during the rainy season in midwinter. The
same can be said of bronchial affections and
pneumonia. The free and unrestrained intercourse
among natives accounts for the rapid spread of
tuberculosis and acute infectious diseases among
the entire population and from island to island.</p>
<p>The sanitary commission now engaged, in
efforts to reduce the mortality of the natives will
establish rules and regulations which will have
for their object the prevention of dissemination
of acute as well as chronic infectious diseases,
and will undoubtedly accomplish much toward
the preservation of the race; but these officers
will meet with stubborn opposition on the part
of the natives when attempts are made, in their
interest, to curtail their personal liberties. The
ties of relationship and friendship among the
natives are very strong, and become most
apparent in case of misfortunes and sickness.
Smallpox breaks out almost every year, and claims its
share of victims. Vaccination is supposed to be
compulsory, but the natives are inclined to escape
it. Vaccination is done gratuitously at the
Military Hospital for all natives who can be induced
to submit to it. Under present conditions it is
almost impossible to reach the inhabitants of the
small atoll islands.</p>
<p>Like in all tropic countries, tetanus is of
quite frequent occurrence. The small native
pony is found everywhere, and as the rural natives
are all barefooted and spend much of their time in
the jungles in impregnating the flower of the
vanilla-bean and gathering fruits, wounds prone
to infection with the tetanus bacillus are of
frequent occurrence.</p>
<p>Malarial diseases are comparatively rare,
although the plasmodium-carrying mosquitoes are
numerous and aggressive, and children in the
country districts are nude, and the men limit their
clothing to the wearing of a loin-cloth. No case
of typhoid fever has been known to have
originated in the island. For this there exists a
satisfactory explanation. The exemption in this
island from this disease, so widely distributed
over the entire part of the inhabited globe, is
due entirely to an abundant supply of the purest
drinking water supplied by the numerous
mountain streams. Nearly all the inhabitants live on
the coast, near the outlet of a brook or stream,
where, consequently, there is no danger whatever
of water-contamination. I found three cases of
typhoid fever in the Military Hospital, members
of one family, who had been brought there from
one of the neighboring atoll islands.</p>
<p>Varicose veins, varicocele and hydrocele are
very common. The absence of anything like a
large ulcer in many cases of large and numerous
varicose veins of the leg, I attributed to the
toughness of the skin of the bare legs. Venereal
diseases are widespread throughout the entire
island, and more especially in Papeete and the
near-by larger villages. For over a hundred years
the natives have suffered from this scourge
brought there by the European sailors and
adventurers. Syphilis has been transmitted from
generation to generation until it has
contaminated the major part of the population, for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gods visit the sins of the fathers upon the
children.</p>
<p>EURIPIDES.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wickedness of a few brings calamity on all.</p>
<p>PUBLIUS SYRUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The length of time the disease has existed
among the natives has established a certain
degree of tolerance or immunity, as it pursues a
comparatively mild course, as I found very few
instances of the ravages of the remote results
of syphilis. I saw only one case of saddle nose,
caused by tertiary syphilis.</p>
<p>Leprosy is not as prevalent as in the Hawaiian
Islands, but isolated cases are found in nearly
all the islands belonging to this group, being more
prevalent in some than in others. Segregation
has never been attempted. The lepers mix freely
with the members of their families and neighbors,
and are not shunned by any one. I was informed
that many of the lepers, much disfigured by the
disease, seek an island where many of these
unfortunates have founded a colony for the purpose
of escaping from public gaze. There, away from
relatives and friends, they spend their short span
of life and await patiently the final relief which
only death can bring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Death, the Healer, scorn thou not, I pray.
To come to me; of cureless ills thou art
The one physician. Pain lays not its touch upon a
corpse.</p>
<p>ÆSCHYLUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elephantiasis in its worst forms has taken a
firm hold on the natives, especially the inhabitants
of the near-by island of Moorea. There this
disease can be studied in all its stages, from a slight
enlargement of one of the extremities to
colossal swellings, which, when the upper and lower
extremities are affected at the same time, make it
necessary for the patient to crawl on his hands
and feet in dragging himself from place to place.
Regarding elephantiasis as it exists in Tahiti and
the other islands of the French colony, I will
make use of a few extracts taken from a valuable
paper on this subject by Dr. Lemoine, recently in
charge of the Military Hospital, and published in
one of the government reports. According to
this author, who has seen much of this disease in
Tahiti and surrounding islands, it may affect
most regions of the body, and not infrequently
makes its appearance as an acute affection with
all the symptoms characteristic of lymphangitis,
including quite a violent continued remittent
form of fever, which lasts two or three months.
The acute form is, almost without exception,
complicated by synovitis of the joints of the
affected limb, which he regards as almost
pathognomonic of the disease, differentiating it from
ordinary forms of lymphangitis. After the
subsidence of the acute symptoms and in the chronic
form the disease is essentially a chronic
lymphangitits, accompanied by marked enlargement of
the veins. According to his observations the
regions most frequently involved are the lower
extremities, external genitals, and lastly, the
hands and forearms. Three years ago I was
given an opportunity to see at the hospital and
poorhouse at Antigua, West Indies, ninety cases
of elephantiasis, and not in a single one of them
did the disease affect the upper extremity, while
in the French colony of the South Seas this is
not infrequently the case. I do not know that
a satisfactory explanation has ever been given
why the disease should behave so differently in
fixing its location in the two groups of islands.
Lemoine, as well as other writers on
elephantiasis, has seen the disease become stationary by
the removal of the patient to a colder climate.
Europeans become susceptible to elephantiatic
infection after a prolonged residence in tropical
countries where the disease prevails.</p>
<p>Lemoine does not agree with Manson, who
believes that elephantiasis is caused by the
<em>Filaria sanguinis</em>, and is suspicious that the
essential parasitic cause is a yet undiscovered microbe.
He made blood examinations night and day of
patients under his care, and was unable to
constantly detect the filariæ in their embryonic state
in the peripheral blood, and consequently claims
that the presence of filaria in the organism is not
an infallible diagnostic indication, and that their
abundance is not proportionate to the intensity
of the disease. The fact that the elephantiatics
improve in colder climates he regards as another
proof that filariasis is not the essential cause of
the disease.</p>

</div>
<p>In a number of cases extirpation of the
infiltrated enlarged lymphatic glands was followed by
decided improvement, and in the case of a
Tahitian the improvement remained at the end of
three years. He has also operated on a number
of cases by partial excision of the mass, first on
one side of the limb, then on the other, with
decided benefit to the patient in most of them. In
some cases deep incisions through the entire
thickness of the indurated mass afforded relief
and resulted in diminution of the size of the
swelling. He relates the details of the case of a
native, fifty years old, the subject of
elephantiasis of the lower limbs, that he operated on in
two stages several weeks apart, removing first a
large section from the anterior and later from
the posterior part of the swelling, and as shown
by the accompanying illustrations in the report
depicting the condition of the limbs before and
after operation, with an excellent result.
However, in some of the cases the benefit thus derived
did not last for any considerable length of time.</p>
<p>In making the excision, the superfluous skin is
excised with the underlying indurated tissues,
and the skin margins reflected for some distance
in order to create sufficient room for a more
liberal removal of the deep tissues. In one case,
that of a woman thirty-eight years of age, the
patient died two weeks after the second operation.
Death was attributed to loss of blood and the
debilitated condition of the patient when she
entered the hospital. In another case, a Tahitian,
thirty-five years old, affected with elephantiasis
of all limbs and the external genitals, he operated
successfully on one of the arms, the seat of an
enormous swelling below the elbow. The excised
mass weighed fifteen kilograms. Owing to the
large size of the swelling, the operation proved
one of great difficulty, and on account of the
tension incident to the approximation of the margins
of the flaps the sutures cut through and the
wound ultimately healed by granulation. At the
second operation nearly the entire mass was
removed, with the result that the wound finally
healed after a prolonged suppuration and the
patient was relieved of the incumbrance caused
by the great weight of the swelling. The relief
afforded induced the patient to request additional
operations for the removal of the swellings
involving other regions of the body, but as the
surgeon soon after left the island his desire could
not be gratified.</p>
<p>The climate of Tahiti is not congenial for
pulmonary and rheumatic affections, as the
atmosphere is too moist. It is admirably adapted for
patients the subjects of nervous affections in all
their protean forms. The quietude, balmy air
and pleasing surroundings are the best
therapeutic agents to secure mental rest and refreshing
sleep. It is in the treatment of such affections
that a trip to Tahiti can not be too strongly
recommended.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-kahuna-or-native-doctor">
<h1>THE KAHUNA OR NATIVE DOCTOR</h1>
<p>For centuries the practice of the healing art
was largely in the hands of priests. They
ministered to the body as well as the soul. Their
practice was purely empirical and the surgery,
even of the most skilled, rude and often brutal.
The human mind is very much inclined to look
upon disease and the methods used to effect
a cure as something mysterious. Even at this
late day many people who are well educated
and who in everything else seem to possess a
liberal amount of good common sense, have very
strange ideas in regard to disease and the means
employed in treatment. Promises to cure and a
liberal expenditure of printers' ink render them
an easy prey to mysterious methods. All races
and all tribes have always had among them men
and women in whom they confided in case of
accident or disease. Very often priesthood and
medicine were combined in the same person.
Among the ancient Tahitians the chief was at
the same time priest and medical adviser. The
American Indians had their medicine-men, the
Tahitians and other South Sea Islanders their
Kahuna. It is very interesting to know
something of the early practice of medicine and
surgery among the Tahitians. Captain Cook
gives them great credit from what he saw of their
surgery:</p>
<blockquote>
They perform cures in surgery, which our extensive
knowledge in that branch has not, as yet, enabled us to
imitate. In simple fractures, they bind them up with
splints, but if part of the substance of the bone be
lost, they insert a piece of wood, between the fractured
ends, made hollow like the deficient part. In five or
six days, the rapooa, or surgeon, inspects the wound,
and finds the wood partly covered with the growing
flesh. In as many more days, it is generally entirely
covered; after which, when the patient has acquired
some strength, he bathes in the water, and recovers.</blockquote>
<p>In speaking of medicine he says:</p>
<blockquote>
Their physical knowledge seems more confined; and
that, probably, because their diseases are fewer than
their accidents. The priests, however, administer the
juices of herbs in some cases; and women who are
troubled with after-pains, or other disorders after
child-bearing, use a remedy which one would think
needless in a hot country. They first heat stones, as
when they bake their food; then they lay a thick cloth
over them, upon which is put a quantity of a small
plant of the mustard kind; and these are covered with
another cloth. Upon this they seat themselves, and
sweat plentifully, to obtain a cure. They have no
emetic medicine.</blockquote>
<p>In referring to the few indigenous diseases
he adds:</p>
<blockquote>
But this was before the arrival of the Europeans;
for we have added to this short category a disease
which abundantly supplies the place of all the others;
and is now almost universal [syphilis]. For this they
seem to have no effectual remedy. The priests, indeed,
sometimes give them a medley of simples; but they own
that it never cures them, and yet, they allow that, in
a few cases, nature, without the assistance of a
physician, exterminates the poison of this fatal disease, and
perfect recovery is produced. They say that a man
affected with it will often communicate it to others in
the same house, by feeding out of the same utensils,
or handling them, and that, in this case, they frequently
die, while he recovers; though we see no reason why
this should happen.</blockquote>
<p>On his fourth voyage to the Society Islands
Captain Cook learned to what fearful extent
syphilis had spread throughout all of the islands
of the group and became aware what ravages it
had caused among the natives. On visiting new
islands he did all in his power to protect the
natives against this scourge by excluding all
women visitors from the ship and by strictly
enjoining persons known to be infected from
landing. On the probable effects of these new
regulations he comments:</p>
<blockquote>
Whether these regulations, dictated by humanity,
had the desired effect, or no, time only can discover.
I had been equally attentive to the same object when
I first visited the Friendly Islands; yet I afterward
found, with real concern, that I had not succeeded, and
I am afraid that this will always be the case, in such
voyages as ours, whenever it is necessary to have a
number of people on shore.</blockquote>

<p class="caption">A CASE OF FAR-ADVANCED LEPROSY AFFECTING ALL LIMBS</p>
</div>
<p>Massage as a remedial agent in the treatment
of disease originated in the Orient, and the
Tahitians were familiar with it and frequently made
use of it. On this subject Captain Cook can
speak from personal experience. During his stay
in Tahiti in 1777 he suffered evidently from a
severe attack of sciatica, the pain extending from
the hip to the toes. King Otoo's mother, his
three sisters and eight more women came on his
ship one evening for the purpose of giving him
treatment and remained all night to fulfill their
well-meant mission. Here is the account of the
treatment to which he was subjected by the
women:</p>
<blockquote>
I accepted the kindly offer, had a bed spread for them
upon the cabin floor, and submitted myself to their
directions. I was desired to lay myself down amongst
them. Then, as many of them as could get around me,
began to squeeze me with both hands, from head to foot,
but more particularly on the parts where the pain was
lodged, till they made my bones crack, and my flesh
became a perfect mummy. In short, after undergoing
this discipline about a quarter of an hour, I was glad to
get away from them. However, the operation gave me
immediate relief, which encouraged me to submit to
another rubbing down before I went to bed; and it
was so efficient that I found myself pretty easy all the
night after. My female physicians repeated their
prescription the next morning, before they went ashore,
and again in the evening, when they returned on board;
after which, I found the pains entirely removed, and
the cure being perfected, they took leave of me the
following morning. This they call <em>romee</em>, an operation
which, in my opinion, far exceeds the flesh-brush, or
anything of the kind that we make use of externally.
It is universally practised amongst the islanders, being
sometimes performed by men, but more generally by
women.</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="physicians-in-tahiti">
<h1>PHYSICIANS IN TAHITI</h1>
<p>Tahiti is not an Eldorado for doctors. The
entire island has only eleven thousand inhabitants
and the great majority of them are too poor to
pay for medical services. The only place in
Tahiti where a doctor can be found is in Papeete.
At the time I visited the island there was only one
physician in private practice in the capital city,
Dr. Chassaniol, a retired naval surgeon, the only
private practitioner in the whole group of islands.
The bulk of medical practice is in the hands of
the government physician, always a military man
who has at the same time charge of the Military
Hospital and takes care of the sick poor, and
supervises all matters pertaining to sanitation.
The only other physicians in the island are the
naval surgeons on board a small man-of-war
almost constantly anchored in the harbor of
Papeete. The government physician is privileged
to practice outside of the hospital, and from this
source he receives the bulk of his income. As
the resident physician and the government
physician are the only qualified physicians in the
whole archipelago, it requires no stretch of the
imagination to realize that until the present time
the French government has not made adequate
provisions for their subjects who require the
services of a physician.</p>

<p>The Tahitians have not lost their faith in their
Kahunas or native doctors, who without any
medical knowledge, practice their art. These
men, with a local reputation as healers of disease,
are to be found in nearly every village. They are
well thought of and are influential members of
society in their respective communities. Like the
medicine-men of our Indians, they make use of
roots, bark and herbs as remedial agents, and the
natives, like many of our own people, have more
faith in this mysterious kind of medication than
in modern, concentrated, palatable drugs
prescribed by the most eminent physician. To the
credit of these native medicine-men, it must be
said that they give to all afflicted who apply for
treatment not only their services, but also the
medicines without any expectation of a financial
reward or even the gratitude of their clients.</p>

<div class="section" id="hopital-militaire">
<h1>HÔPITAL MILITAIRE</h1>
<p>The military hospital at Papeete is the only one
in the French colonial possession of the Society
Islands, numbering one hundred and sixty-eight
islands and containing thirty thousand
inhabitants, of whom eleven thousand live in Tahiti.
As some of these islands are more than one
hundred miles apart, it is somewhat strange that
the French government has not taken earlier
action in establishing small cottage hospitals in
a number of the larger islands, as in case of
severe injuries or sudden illness the natives of
the distant islands are not within reach of timely
medical aid and the transportation of a sick or
injured person to Papeete from the far-off islands
or villages by small schooners or canoes is
necessarily slow and in many instances dangerous.
The Sanitary Commission now stationed in the
islands will, it is to be hoped, act promptly in
remedying this serious defect in the care of the
sick natives.</p>

<p class="caption">MILITARY HOSPITAL IN PAPEETE</p>
</div>
<p>The Military Hospital at Papeete is an old
structure of brick and cement, situated near the
western limits of the city in a large square yard
inclosed by a high stone wall, surmounted by a
crest of fragments of glass, which imparts to the
inclosure a prison-like appearance, the austerity
of which, however, is much relieved by
beautiful tropical trees, shrubbery and flowers in front
of the entrance and in the courtyard. The
hospital proper comprises seven buildings, only one
of which is two stories high. The hospital has
accommodations for forty beds. The officers'
rooms contain two beds each; the remaining space
is divided into small wards for privates and
civilians. In one ward, the windows of which
are strongly barred, are kept the military
prisoners, and another small ward is devoted to
obstetrical cases. The rooms and wards are well
ventilated and clean, the beds comfortable; the
hospital furniture otherwise is scanty and antique.
The drug-room is large, richly supplied with
capacious jars, mortars of all sizes, herbs, roots
and a complete outfit for making infusions,
decoctions and tinctures, which reminds one very
vividly of an apothecary shop of half a century
ago. This department is in charge of a
pharmacist who, besides mixing drugs, does some
chemical and bacteriological work in a small and
imperfectly equipped laboratory. The
operating-room is an open passageway between two
adjoining wards, and all it contained suggestive of its
use were an operating table of prodigious size
and decidedly primitive construction, and,
suspended from the wall, a tin irrigator, to which was
attached a long piece of rubber tubing of
doubtful age. The hospital is well supplied with water,
and contains a bathroom, a shower-bath and
modern closets. The hospital is in charge of the
government physician, who is always a medical
officer of the colonial troops, detailed for this
special service, usually for a period of three
years. From the official reports I gleaned that
on an average this institution takes care of about
three hundred and fifty patients a year. At the
time of my visit the number of patients did not
exceed fifteen, among them one in the prison
ward. All of the patients were the subjects of
trifling affections, with the exception of three
cases of typhoid fever sent to the hospital from
one of the atoll islands. The patients are being
cared for by three Catholic sisters and orderlies
as they are needed. The poor are admitted
gratuitously; private patients pay from six to fifteen
francs a day. The hospital is beautifully located
on the principal street of the city and faces the
charming little harbor. A small private hospital
for the foreign residents and tourists is needed
here and under proper management would prove
a remunerative investment.</p>

<p>The wealth of Tahiti is on its surface. Its
mountains are not pregnant with precious metals
nor has nature stored up in their interior material
for fuel and illumination, as none of these are
needful to make the people content and happy.
The Tahitian has no desire to accumulate wealth;
the warm rays of the sun reduce the use of
fuel to a minimum, and the millions of glittering
stars and the soft silvery light of the moon in
the clear blue sky create a bewitching light at
night, which, more than half of the time, would
make artificial illumination a mockery. Then,
too, Tahiti is the land of gentle sleep and
pleasant dreams, where people do not turn night into
day, but rise with the sun and retire soon after
he disappears in the west behind the vast expanse
of the ocean. God created Tahiti for an ideal
island home and not as a place for get-rich-quick
methods, speculation and bitter competition for
business, for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where wealth and freedom reign, contentment fails,</p>
<p>And <em>honor lacks</em> where commerce long prevails.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Tahiti's fabulous wealth consists in its
inexhaustible soil and the perennial warm, stimulating
breath of the tropic sun. It is the island of
never-fading verdure and vigorous and
never-ceasing vegetation. The fertile soil, the abundant
rainfall throughout the year, the warm sunshine
and the equable climate are most conducive to
plant-life and here these conditions are so
harmonious that there can be no failure of crops in
the Lord's plantation. There never has been a
famine in Tahiti, and there never will be,
provided the government protects the magnificent
mountain forests—nature's system of irrigation.
Tahiti's food-supply is select and never-failing,
and is furnished man with the least possible
exertion on his part. The bounteous provisions
nature has made here for the abode of man are
a marvel to the visitor and after he has once
seen them and has become familiar with them he
can not escape the conclusion that he is in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p>JEREMIAH xxxii:22.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The food products and fruits grown in the
forests without the toil of man are admirably
adapted for the climatic conditions, being
laxative and cooling, and undoubtedly account for the
excellent health of the natives before the invasion
of the island by the Europeans. The island was
destined for the natives, and the natives were
suited to the island.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Content with what the sea and forest provided

affairs were managed to suit the wants of the
people, and if any one in power failed in his
duties, the people took the law in their own hands
and corrected the evil, usually without bloodshed.

<h1>TAHITI'S NATURAL BREAD SUPPLY</h1>
<p>The Tahitians have no corn or grain of any
kind out of which to make bread. They
found in the forests excellent substitutes for
bread, and more healthful for that climate, in
the form of breadfruit, wild plantain and tubers
rich in starch. This is the kind of bread they have
been eating for centuries, and which they prefer
to our bread to-day. When the island was
densely populated and the demand on nature's
resources exceeded the supply, the natives had to
plant trees, roots and tubers in vacant spaces in
the forest, high up on the mountainsides, where
they grew luxuriantly without any or little care,
and by these trifling efforts on the part of man
the food-supply kept pace with the increase of
the population. Trees and plants distributed in
this manner found a permanent home in the new
places provided for them, and have since
multiplied, and thus increased greatly the annual yield.
Evidences of dissemination of bread and
fruit-yielding trees and plants by the intervention of
man are apparent to-day throughout the island
by the presence of cocoa-palms, breadfruit and
other fruit trees, and plantains, in localities where
nature could not plant them, in places formerly
inhabited but abandoned long ago when the
population became so rapidly decimated by the
virulent diseases introduced into the island by the
Europeans. To-day the fruit and fruit-supply is
so abundant that it is within easy reach of every
family and can be had without money and
without labor. We will consider here a few of the
most important substitutes for bread on which
the Tahitians largely subsist:</p>

<p class="caption">TAHITIAN FRUIT VENDER</p>
</div>
<p><em>Breadfruit</em>.—Breadfruit is the most important
article of food of the Tahitians. It is the fruit
of the breadfruit tree <em>Arfocarpus incisiva</em>
(Linné), a tree of the natural order,
<em>Artocarpaceæ</em>, a native of the islands of the Pacific
Ocean and of the Indian Archipelago. This
fruit is one of the most important gifts of nature
to the inhabitants of the tropics, serving as the
principal part of their food, the inner tough bark
of the tree furnishing a good material for native
cloth, while the trunk of the tree is used as a
material for canoes. The exudation issuing from
cuts made into the stem, a resinous substance, is
in use for closing the seams of canoes. Several
varieties of breadfruit trees are to be found in
Tahiti, differing in the structure of their leaves
and in the size and time of ripening of the fruit,
so that ripe breadfruit is obtainable more or less
abundantly throughout the year. The foliage of
this tree is the greenest of all green, and it is
this deep green which distinguished this tree at
once from its neighbors. The male flowers are
in catkins, with a two-leaved perianth and one
stamen; the female flowers are nude. The leaves
are large, pinnatifid, frequently twelve to eighteen
inches long, smooth and glossy on their upper
surface. The much branched tree attains a height
of twenty to fifty feet. The fruit is a <em>sorosis</em>,
a compound or aggregate the size of a child's
head, round or slightly oblong, light green, fleshy
and tuberculated on the surface. The rind is
thick, and marked with small square or
lozenge-shaped divisions, each having a small elevation
in the middle. The fruit hangs by a short, thick
stalk from the small branches, singly or in
clusters of two or three together. It contains a white,
somewhat fibrous pulp, which when ripe becomes
juicy and yellow, but has then a rotten taste.
The fruit is gathered for use before it is ripe, and
the pulp is then white and mealy, of the
consistence of fresh bread. The fruit is prepared in
many ways for food, roasted on hot coals, boiled
or baked, or converted by the experienced native
cook into complicated dainty dishes. The
common practice in Tahiti is to cut each fruit into
three or four pieces and take out the core; then to
place heated stones in the bottom of a hole dug
in the ground; to cover them with green leaves,
and upon this place a layer of the fruit, then
stones, leaves and fruit alternately, till the hole
is nearly filled, when leaves and earth to the
depth of several inches are spread over all. In
half an hour the breadfruit is ready; the outsides
are, in general, nicely browned, and the inner
part presents a white or yellowish cellular
substance. Breadfruit prepared in this manner and
by other methods of cooking is very palatable, as
I can speak from my own experience, slightly
astringent and highly nutritious, a most excellent
dietetic article for the tropics. The tree is very
prolific, producing two and sometimes three crops
a year. When once this tree has gained a firm
foothold in a soil it cherishes, and in a climate it
enjoys, it exhibits a tenacity to reproduce itself
to an extent often beyond desirable limits. Of
this Captain Cook writes:</p>
<blockquote>
I have inquired very carefully into their manner
of cultivating the breadfruit tree; but was always
answered that they never plant it. The breadfruit tree
plants itself, as it springs from the roots of the old
ones, so that the natives are often under the necessity
of preventing its progress to make room for trees of
other sorts to afford some variety in their food.</blockquote>
<p>The timber is soft and light, of a rich yellow
color, and assumes when exposed to the air the
appearance of mahogany.</p>
<p><em>Manioc</em>.—Manioc is another important article
of food in Tahiti and likewise serves as an
excellent substitute for baker's bread. It is the large,
fleshy root of <em>Manihot utilissima</em>, a large,
half-shrubby plant of the natural order <em>Euphorhiaceæ</em>,
a native of tropical America, and much cultivated
in Tahiti as an article of food. In this island the
plant has run wild in some of the ravines formerly
inhabited. The plant grows in a bushy form,
with stems usually six to eight feet high, but
sometimes much higher. The stems are brittle,
white, and have a very large pith; the branches
are crooked. The leaves are near the ends of the
branches, large, deeply seven-parted, smooth and
deep green. The roots are very large,
turnip-like, sometimes weighing thirty pounds, from
three to eight growing in a cluster, usually from
twelve to twenty-four inches in length. They
contain an acrid, milky juice in common with other
parts of the plant, so poisonous as to cause death
in a few minutes; but as the toxic effect is owing
to the presence of hydrocyanic acid, which is
quickly removed by heat, the juice, inspissated
by boiling, forms the excellent sauce called
<em>casareep</em>; and fermented with molasses it yields
an intoxicating beverage called <em>onycou</em>; whilst
the root, grated, dried on hot metal plates and
roughly powdered, becomes an article of food.
It is made into thin plates which are formed into
cakes, not by mixing with water, but by the action
of heat, softening and agglutinating the particles
of starch. The powdered root prepared in this
manner is an easily digestible and nutritious
article of farinaceous food. The root is largely
made use of in the manufacture of starch and is
exported from Tahiti for this purpose to a
considerable extent. The starch made from this
root is also known as Brazilian arrowroot, and
from it tapioca is made. Manioc is propagated
by cuttings of the stem, and is of rapid growth,
attaining maturity in six months.</p>
<p><em>Sweet Cassava</em>.—Sweet cassava is the root of
<em>Manihot Aipi</em>, a woody plant indigenous to
tropical South America, growing in great abundance
in the dense forest of the mountain valleys of
Tahiti. The plant grows to a height of several
feet and has large long leaves growing from the
foot of the stem. The root is reddish and
nontoxic; it can therefore be used as a culinary
esculent, without any further preparation than
boiling, while its starch can also be converted
into tapioca. The <em>Aipi</em> has tough, woody fibres,
extending along the axis of the tubers, while
generally the roots of the manioc (bitter cassava)
are free from this central woody substance.</p>
<p><em>Arrowroot</em> or <em>Arru Root</em>.—The commercial
arrowroot is prepared from different
starch-yielding roots, but the bulb of the <em>Maranta
marantaceæ</em> produces more starch and of a better
quality than any of the others. It is a native of
the West Indies and South America, and is
cultivated quite extensively in Tahiti. Many little
patches of this plant may be seen along the road
from Papeete to Papara, where the lowland soil
is well adapted for its cultivation. The
starch-producing plant which is cultivated most
extensively in Tahiti and other South Sea Islands is
the <em>Tacca pinnatifolia</em>. This perennial plant will
even thrive well in the sandy soil near the shore.
The stalk, with terminal spreading pinnatifid
leaves, is from two to three feet high and the root
is a tuber about the size of a small potato. The
tacca starch is much valued in medicine, and is
particularly used in the treatment of inflammatory
affections of the gastro-intestinal canal.</p>
<p><em>Taro or Tara</em>.—Taro is another very
important food-product of Tahiti, as well as other
islands of the Pacific, notably the Hawaiian
Islands. It is the root of <em>Colocasia macrorhiza</em>,
a plant of the natural order <em>Araceæ</em>, of the same
genus with <em>cocoa</em>. The plant thrives best in low,
marshy places. In all of the South Sea Islands
it is very extensively cultivated for its roots, which
constitute in these islands a staple article of food,
excellent substitutes for potatoes and bread. The
roots are very large, from twelve to sixteen
inches in length, and as much in circumference.
They are washed in cold water to take away their
acridity, which is such as to cause excoriation of
the mouth and palate. The roots are cooked in
the same way as the breadfruit, the rind being
first scraped off. Another very common way of
eating taro is in the form of <em>poi</em>. This method
of preparing the root was known to the Tahitians
when Captain Cook visited the island. He
compared <em>poi</em> with &quot;sour pudding.&quot; It requires some
skill to make <em>poi</em>. The root, finely grated, is
allowed to ferment over night. It tastes sour and
is a refreshing, delicate and nutritious dish, when
served ice-cold. The plant has no stalk; the
petioled heart-shaped leaves spring from the root.
The flower is in the form of a spathe. The boiled
leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach.</p>
<p><em>Wild Plantain</em>.—The wild plantain furnishes
its liberal share of food-supply for the
Tahitians. It is a tree-like, perennial herb (<em>Musa
paradisiaca</em>) with immense leaves and large
clusters of the fruits. In its appearance it
resembles very closely the banana, but differs from
it as the hands and fingers of the bunches of fruit
are turned in the opposite direction. The fruit is
long and somewhat cylindrical, slightly curved,
and, when ripe, soft, fleshy and covered with a
thick but tender yellowish skin. This plant is
indigenous to Tahiti and is found in abundance in
the forests. The fruit is cooked or baked and
is keenly relished by the natives.</p>
<p>All of the articles of food I have referred to
above are easily digested, palatable and nutritious,
and for the Tahiti climate more healthful than
bread and potatoes, on which the masses of
people living in colder climates subsist to a large
extent. I attribute the comparative immunity of
the South Sea Islanders from attacks of
appendicitis principally to their diet, which is laxative,
easily digested and not liable to cause
fermentation in the gastro-intestinal canal.
Appendicitis does occur in these islands, but this disease
is extremely rare as compared with the frequency
with which it is met in Europe, and more
especially in the United States. The Americans
are the most injudicious and reckless eaters in
the world, which goes far in explaining the
prevalence of gastric and intestinal disorders
among our people.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-cocoanut-the-meat-of-the-tahitians">
<h1>THE COCOANUT, THE MEAT OF THE TAHITIANS</h1>
<p>It is fortunate that the inhabitants of the
tropics have no special liking for a meat diet,
as the free indulgence in meat could not fail in
resulting detrimentally to the health of the
inhabitants. The continuously high temperature
begets indolence, and indolence tends to diminish
secretion and excretion, conditions incompatible
with a habitual consumption of meat. Nature
has established fixed rules concerning the manner
of living in the tropics. She deprives man of the
appetite for meat and other equally heavy articles
of food, and supplies him with nourishment
adapted for the climate. It is under such climatic
conditions that we are made to realize that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more we deny ourselves, the more the gods
supply our wants.</p>
<p>HORATIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can not use the mind aright when the body is
filled with excess of food.</p>
<p>CICERO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the preservation of health in the tropics,
it is necessary that the food should be laxative,
cooling, easy of digestion and nutritious. Fish
and fruit of various kinds meet these
requirements. From observations and experience, the
ignorant natives have made a wise selection of
what is best for them to eat, and know what to
avoid. High living brings its dire results in
temperate and cold climates, but any one
indulging in it in the tropics will curtail his life, as it
can not fail to be productive, in a short time, of
organic changes of a degenerative type in
important internal organs, which soon begin to
menace life and never fail in diminishing the vital
resistance against acute diseases. Luxury in the
tropics in the way of eating and drinking is a
dangerous experiment, and it is well to remember,
especially when living in a hot climate, that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By degrees man passes to the enjoyments of a vicious
life, porticoes, baths and elegant banquets; this by the
ignorant was called a civilized mode of living, though
in reality it was only a form of luxury.</p>
<p>TACTICUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No such mistakes are made by the natives of
Tahiti as long as they remain true to their
ancient manner of living. With few exceptions,
indeed, they lack the means of imitating the
foreigners in living a life of luxury. Any native
who departs too far from the simple, natural life
of his ancestors will pay dearly for the doubtful
pleasures of a life of luxury. The average native,
fortunately, has no such inclinations; he is
satisfied to live the simple, natural life his forefathers
led, and he follows the scriptural advice.</p>
<blockquote>
And having food and raiment, let us be therewith
content. I. Timothy vi:8.</blockquote>

<p>Nature has provided for the South Sea
Islanders something better than beef and mutton
in the form of meat—fish and cocoanut. Fish
are very abundant all around the coast of Tahiti,
and the lagoons, where the fishing is mostly done,
are as quiet as inland lakes. More than two
hundred varieties of fish have been found in
these waters. But the real and best meat for the
Tahitians is the cocoanut. The meat of this
wonderful nut contains a large per cent, of oil,
which supplies the system with all the fatty
material it requires, and for the tropic climate
this bland, nutritious vegetable oil is far superior
to any animal fats. We will give here the
Cocoa-palm the liberal space it so well deserves:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-cocoa-palm">
<h1>THE COCOA-PALM</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Through groves of palm</p>
<p>Sigh gales of balm,</p>
<p>Fire-flies on the air are wheeling;</p>
<p>While through the gloom</p>
<p>Comes soft perfume,</p>
<p>The distant beds of flowers revealing.</p>
<p>SIR WALTER SCOTT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cocoa-palm is the queen of the forests of
the South Sea Islands. The tall, slender,
branchless, silvery stem and fronded crown of this
graceful tree distinguish it at once from all its
neighbors and indicate the nobility of its race.
The great clusters of golden fruit of giant size,
partially obscured by the drooping leaves and
clinging to the end of the stem, supply the natives
with the necessities of life. The cocoa-palm is
the greatest benefactor of the inhabitants of the
tropics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is meat, drink and cloth to us.</p>
<p>RABELAIS.</p>
<p>Fruits of palm-tree, pleasantest to thirst</p>
<p>And hunger both.</p>
<p>MILTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This noble tree grows and fructifies where hard
manual labor is incompatible with the climate, in
islands and countries where the natives have to
rely largely on the bounteous resources of nature
for food and protection. The burning shores of
India and the islands of the South Pacific are
the natural homes of the cocoa-palm. It has a
special predilection for the sandy beach of Tahiti
and the innumerable atoll islands near to and far
from this gem of the South Seas. The giant nuts
often drop directly into the sea and are carried
away by waves and currents from their native
soil to strange islands, where they are cast upon
the sandy shore, to sprout and prosper for the
benefit of other native or visiting tribes. By this
manner of dissemination, all of these islands have
become encircled by a lofty colonnade of this
queen of the tropics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beautiful isles! beneath the sunset skies</p>
<p>Tall silver shafted palm-trees rise between</p>
<p>Tall orange trees that shade</p>
<p>The living colonnade:</p>
<p>Alas! how sad, how sickening is the scene</p>
<p>That were ye at my side would be a paradise.</p>
<p>MARIA BROOKS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cocoa-palm (<em>Cocos nucifera</em>), is a native
of the Indian coasts and the South Sea Islands.
It belongs to a genus of palms having pinnate
leaves or fronds, and male and female flowers on
the same tree, the latter at the base of each spadix.
It is seldom found at any considerable distance
from the seacoast, except where it has been
introduced by man, and generally thrives best
near the very edge of the sea. In Tahiti isolated
cocoa-palms are found on the lofty hilltops,
projecting, with their proud crowns of pale green
leaves, far above the level of the sea of the dense
forest and impenetrable jungles. This
transplantation from shore to the sides and summits of
the foot-hills had its beginning before the
discovery of the island, when the overpopulation made
it necessary to provide for a more abundant
food-supply. There it has prospered and multiplied
since without the further aid of man, yielding its
rich harvests of fruit with unfailing regularity.
The frightful reduction in the number of
inhabitants since the white man set his foot on the
island has made this additional food-supply
superfluous, as the palms within easier reach in
the lowlands along the shore more than meet the
present demands.</p>

<p>The cocoa-palm is a proud but virtuous tree.
Its dense cluster of delicate roots does not
encroach upon the territory of other trees, but claims
only a very modest circular patch of soil from
which to abstract the nourishment for the
unselfish, philanthropic tree. The base of the stem
is wide and usually inclined, but a few feet
from the ground becomes straight and cylindrical,
with nearly the same diameter from base to
crown. The curve of the stem is caused by the
effects of the prevailing winds on the yielding,
slender stem of the youthful tree, but with
increasing growth and strength, it rises column-like
into the air, balancing its fruit-laden massive
crown in uncompromising opposition to the
invisible aerial force. It is only in localities
exposed to the full power of strong and
persistent trade-winds that the full-grown trees lean
in the same direction in obedience to the
unrelenting common deforming cause. The
full-grown tree is, on an average, two feet in diameter,
and from sixty to one hundred feet high, with
many rings marking the places of former leaves,
and having, at its summit, a crown of from
sixteen to twenty leaves, which generally droop, and
are from twelve to twenty feet in length. These
giant leaves furnish an excellent material for
thatched roofs, and in case of need, a few leaves,
properly placed, will make a comfortable,
waterproof tent. The fruit grows in short racemes,
which bear, in favorable situations, from five to
fifteen nuts; and ten or twelve of these racemes,
in different stages of fructification, may be seen
at once on a tree, about eighty or one hundred
nuts being its ordinary annual product. For the
purpose of answering the requirements of
primitive man, the Creator has ordained that this tree
shall yield a continuous harvest from one end of
the year to the other. Flowers and fruit in all
stages of ripening grace the crown at all times
of the year. The young cocoanut contains the
delicious, cooling milk, and the soft pulp, a
nourishing article of food. The mature nut is
an excellent substitute for meat, as the kernel
contains more than seventy per cent, of a fixed,
bland, nutritious oil. The tree bears fruit in from
seven to eight years from the time of planting,
and its lifetime is from seventy to eighty years.
Its greatest ambition during youth is to reach the
clouds and equal its oldest neighbors in height.
Young trees, with a stem less than four inches in
diameter, rival their veteran neighbors in height,
devoting their future growth to the increase in
the dimension and strength of the stem, and their
vital vigor to the bearing of its perennial,
unfailing yield of fruit for the benefit of man and
beast. The stem, when young, contains a central
part which is sweet and edible, but when old,
this is a mass of hard fibre. The terminal bud
(palm cabbage) is esteemed a delicacy when
boiled or stewed or raw in the form of a
vegetable salad. The sweet sap (toddy) of the
cocoa-palm, as of some other palms, is an
esteemed beverage in tropic countries, either in its
natural state, or after fermentation, which takes
place in a few hours; and, from the fermented
sap (palm wine), a strong alcoholic liquor
(<em>arrack</em>), is obtained by distillation. The root of
the cocoa-palm possesses narcotic properties.
Every part of this wonderful tree is utilized by
the untutored inhabitants of the tropics. The
dried leaves are much used for the thatch, and
for many other purposes, as the making of mats,
screens, baskets, etc., by plaiting the leaflets.
The strong midribs of the leaves supply the
natives with oars. The wood of the lower part
of the trunk is very hard, and takes a beautiful
polish. The fibrous centre of old stems is made
into salad. By far the most important fibrous
part of the cocoa-palm is the coir, the fibre of the
husk of the imperfectly ripened nut. The
sun-dried husk of the ripe nut is used for fuel, and
also, when cut across, for polishing furniture,
scrubbing floors, etc. The shell of the nut is
made into cups, goblets, ladles, etc., and these
household articles are often finely polished and
elaborately ornamented by carving. This, the
most generous of all trees, from the time of its
birth until it yields to the ravages of time, serves
man in hundreds of different ways, furnishing
him with food and drink, clothing,
building-material, fuel, medicine, most exquisite delicacies,
wine, spirits and many articles of comfort and
even of luxury. What other tree but the
cocoa-palm could have been in the mind of Milton when
he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In heav'n the trees</p>
<p>Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines</p>
<p>Yield nectar.</p>

<p>The cocoa-palm is a peaceful, modest, virtuous
tree. It prefers its own kin, but is charitable to
its neighbors, irrespective of race. It towers
far above the sea of less favored trees, which find
in its shade protection against the burning rays
of the tropic sun and the fury of the trade-winds.
Proudly it stands guard at the shores of the
coral-girt islands of the South Pacific, waving its
lofty, fruit-laden crown, responding alike to the
cool, refreshing land breezes and the humid
trade-winds in the balmy air of the tropics.
Peaceful and lovely is a forest of palms, where</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaves live only to enjoy love, and throughout the
forest every tree is luxuriating in affectionate embrace;
palm, as it nods to palm, joins in mutual love; the
poplar sighs for the poplar; plane whispers to plane,
and alder to alder.</p>
<p>CLAUDIANUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sight of a forest of cocoa-palms from a
distance is imposing, a walk through it full of
enchantment. Nowhere does this noble tree
appear to better advantage than in Tahiti. This,
the most favored of all islands, is engirdled by an
almost unbroken belt of palm-forest, stretching
from the very verge of the ocean to the base of
the foot-hills, with the towering, tree-clad
mountains for a background; a forest planted by the
invisible hand of Nature, a forest cared for by
Nature, a forest which produces nearly all of the
necessities of life for the natives from day to
day, and year to year, with unfailing regularity.
Enter this forest and the eye feasts on a scene
which neither the pen of the most skilled
naturalist nor the brush of the ablest landscape artist
can reproduce with anything that would do
justice to nature's inexhaustible resources and
artistic designs. Such a scene must be gazed
upon to be appreciated. Between the colonnade of
symmetrical silvery stems and crowns of feathery
fronds, inlaid with the ponderous golden fruit,
the eye catches glimpses of the blue, placid ocean,
the foam-crested breakers, of the still more
beautifully blue dome of the sky, the deep green
carpet of the unbroken tropic forest thrown over
the mountainsides, or the naked, rugged, brown
peaks basking in the sunlight, and on all sides
flowers of various hues and most delicate tints.
Surely,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who can paint</p>
<p>Like Nature? Can imagination boast.</p>
<p>Amid its gay creation, hues like hers,</p>
<p>Or can it mix them with that matchless skill.</p>
<p>And lose them in each other, as appears</p>
<p>In every bud that blows?</p>
<p>THOMSON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add to the pleasures flashed upon the mind by
the ravished eye, the perfumed, soothing air of
the tropics, the sweet sounds of the aeolian harp
as the gentle breeze strikes its well-timed chords
in the fronded crowns of the palms overhead, the
bubbling of the ripples of the near-by ocean as
they kiss the sandy rim of the island shore, and
the clashes of the breakers as they strike with
unerring regularity the coral reef, the outer wall of
the calm lagoon, and your soul will be in a mood
to join the poet in singing the praises of nature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Nature!</p>
<p>Enrich me with knowledge of thy works:</p>
<p>Snatch me to heaven!</p>
<p>THOMSON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Queen of the tropic isles, guardian of their
sun-kissed strands, friend of their dusky, simple
children of Nature! Continue in the future as
you have done in the past, to dispense your work
of generosity and unselfish charity, to sustain and
protect the life of man and beast in a climate you
love and revere, a climate adverse for man to
earn his daily bread by the sweat of his brow!
I have seen your charms in your favorite
island-abode and studied with interest your innumerable
deeds of generosity, your full storehouse for the
urgent needs of man and your safe refuge for
the inhabitants of the air. Had Whittier visited
the island Paradise, your native home, he would
have written in the positive in the first stanza,
when he framed that beautiful verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know not where His islands lift</p>
<p>Their fronded palms in air;</p>
<p>I only know I can not drift</p>
<p>Beyond His love and care!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no other country and no other island
in the world that has such a variety of
indigenous fruit trees as Tahiti. Add to these trees
that have furnished the natives with an
abundance of fruit for centuries, the fruit trees that
have been introduced since the island was
discovered, and many of which flourish now in a
wild state in the forests, and it will give some
idea concerning the wealth of fruit to be found in
the forests of Tahiti. Most of the inland
habitations away from the coast have been abandoned
long ago, and in all these places, in the valleys
and high up on the mountainsides, many kinds
of exogenous fruit trees, planted by former
generations, have gained a permanent foothold. Here
they multiply, blossom, ripen their fruit, and all
the islanders have to do is to gather the annual
crop. Here delicious little thin-skinned oranges
grow, and the finest lemons and limes can be had
for the gathering. The poor find here</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fruits of all kinds in coat</p>

<p>Nothing reminds one more of Tahiti being the
forbidden Garden of Eden, than the abundance of
fruit that grows in the forests without the
intervention of man. Some kind of fruit can be found
during all seasons of the year, and</p>

<p>The redd'ning orange and the swelling grain.</p>
<p>ADDISON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as the poorest of the poor have access to Nature's
orchard and can fill their palm-leaf baskets with
the choicest fruits. The Tahitian</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He feeds on fruits, which of their own accord</p>
<p>The willing ground and laden tree afford.</p>
<p>DRYDEN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mingling, in the most friendly manner, of
the old forest trees with familiar fruit trees
introduced from distant lands and laden with
golden fruit, is a most beautiful sight. The fruit
trees stand their ground even against the most
aggressive shrubs, and it is often no easy matter
to reach the ripe hiding fruit in the dense
network of branches thrown around and between the
branches of the imprisoned tree. What a
blessing these acid fruits are to the natives, sweltering
under the rays of the tropic sun! How easy it
is for them to make a cooling, refreshing drink!
Take a young cocoanut, open it at one end, and
add to its milk the juice of a lime or a lemon, and
the healthiest and most refreshing drink is made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bear me, Pomona! to thy citron groves,</p>
<p>To where the lemon and the piercing lime,</p>
<p>With the deep orange glowing through the green,</p>
<p>Their lighter glories lend.</p>

<p>It is claimed that the large apple family is the
descendant of the Siberian crab-apple, modified
by climate, soil and grafting. This statement
appears to me incorrect, as I have seen a tree in
the Hawaiian forests which bears a real sweet
apple which in shape and taste has a strong
resemblance to the apples of our orchards. The
tree is from twenty to thirty feet in height,
slender and few branched. The same tree is
found in the forests of Tahiti, and its fruit is
much sought after by the natives. It would be
difficult to connect the wild apple tree of the
South Sea Islands with the Siberian crab-apple,
to which it bears no resemblance, either in the
appearance of the tree or its fruit. Let us now
consider a few of the fruit trees which adorn and
enrich the forests of Tahiti:</p>
<p><em>Alligator Pear</em>, or <em>Avocado</em>.—This is the most
delicate and luscious of all the fruit-products of
the Tahitian forests, where it is found in its wild
state in great abundance. It is the fruit of the
<em>Persea gratissima</em>, a tree belonging to the natural
order <em>Lauraceæ</em>, an evergreen tree of the tropic
regions of America and the South Sea Islands.
It attains a height of from thirty to seventy feet,
with a slender stem and dome-like, leafy top.
The branches, like the stem, are slender, and
ascend on quite an acute angle from their base.
The leaves resemble those of the laurel. The
flowers are small, and are produced toward the
extremities of the branches. The fruit is a drupe,
but in size and shape resembles a large pear.
The rind is green, thin, and somewhat rough on
the outside. In the center of the pulp is a large,
heart-shaped kernel, wrapped in a thin,
paper-like membrane. The pulp is green or yellowish,
not very sweet, but of a delicious taste and
exiquisite flavor, and contains about eight per cent,
of a greenish fixed oil. The way to eat this
delicious fruit is to cut it in two lengthwise,
remove the kernel, season with sweet oil,
vinegar, salt and pepper, and eat with a teaspoon.
In the form of a salad it is one of the daintiest
of all dishes. The softness of the pulp and the
richness in oil have led the French to call this
fruit &quot;Vegetable butter.&quot; The seeds of the
alligator pear have come into medical use at the
instance of Dr. Froehlig, and particularly through
the efforts of Park, Davis &amp; Co.,
a manufacturing firm. The alligator pear is a very perishable
fruit, which accounts for its scarcity and
fabulous price in our markets.</p>
<p><em>Pawpaw or Papaya</em> is the fruit of the <em>Carica
Papaya</em>, natural order <em>Papayaceæ</em>. It is an
exceedingly graceful, branchless little tree, which
grows to the height of from ten to twenty feet
and is of short vitality. Its natural home is
in South America and the islands of the Pacific.
The cylindrical stem is grayish white, roughened
in circles where the previous whorls of leaves
had their attachment. The leaves are from
twenty to thirty inches long and are arranged
in the form of a whorl at the very top of the stem,
where also the fruit grows, close to the stem.
The fruit when ripe is light yellow, very similar
to a small melon, and with a somewhat similar
flavor. The skin is very thin and the pulp
exceedingly soft, hence a very perishable fruit.
The seeds are numerous, round and black, and
when chewed have, in a high degree, the
pungency of cresses. It requires time to acquire a
taste for this healthy, very digestible tropical
fruit, but when once developed, it is keenly
relished. It is eaten either raw or boiled. It
possesses digestive properties of considerable
value, which have been utilized in the preparation
of a vegetable pepsin. The acrid, milky sap of
the tree or the juice of the fruit much diluted
with water, renders any tough meat washed with
it, tender for cooking purposes, by separating
the muscular fibres (Dr. Holder). It is said
even the exhalations from the tree have this
property; and meats, fowls, etc., are hung among
its leaves to prepare them for cooking. The tree
is of very rapid growth, bears fruit all the year
and is very prolific.</p>
<p><em>Mango</em> is the fruit of <em>Mangifera Indica</em>. It
is a stately, broad-branching, very shady tree,
from thirty to forty feet in height, belonging to
the natural order <em>Anacardiaceæ</em>. The stem is
short, from eight to ten feet, when it divides
into long, graceful branches, with an
impenetrable foliage, a fine protection against the
rain and the scorching rays of the sun. The
bark is almost black and somewhat rough. The
leaves are in clusters, lanceolate, entire, alternate,
petioled, smooth, shining, tough, and about
seven inches long, with an agreeable resinous
smell. The flowers are small, reddish white or
yellowish, in large, erect, terminal panicles. The
fruit is kidney-shaped, smooth, greenish yellow,
with or without ruddy cheeks, varying greatly
in size and quality, and containing a large,
flattened stone, which is covered on the outside
with fibrous filaments, largest and most abundant
in the inferior varieties, some of which consist
chiefly of fibre and juice, while the finer ones
have a comparatively solid pulp. The size varies
from that of a large plum to that of a man's
fist. The largest and finest mangoes are found
in Tahiti. The fruit is luscious and agreeably
sweet, with an aromatic flavor and slightly acid
taste. The kernels are nutritious, and have been
cooked for food in times of scarcity. A mango
tree laden with its golden fruit is a pleasing
sight, and reminds one vividly of a Christmas
tree.</p>
<p><em>Lime</em>.—The fruit of <em>Citrus Planchoni, Citrus
Australis Planchon</em>. The lime tree of Tahiti was
undoubtedly introduced from Eastern Australia,
where it is found as a noble tree, fully forty feet
high, or, according to C. Hartmann, even sixty
feet high. In Tahiti the tree is small, and in the
dense jungles hardly exceeds the size of a shrub.
The stem, as well as its numerous slender,
wide-spreading, prickly branches, is very crooked. The
fruit is similar to the lemon, but much smaller
in size, being only about one and one-half inches
in diameter, and almost globular in shape, with a
smooth, green, thin rind and an extremely acid,
pungent juice. For a thirst-quenching drink,
the lime-juice is far preferable to the lemon.</p>
<p><em>Pomegranate</em>.—The fruit of <em>Punica Granatum</em>,
a shrub belonging to the natural order
<em>Granataceæ</em>. This historic and useful shrub grows
luxuriantly and with little or no care, in the fertile,
sun-kissed soil of Tahiti. More than one-half
of the interior of the oval purple fruit consists
of large black seeds. The seedless variety has
evidently never been introduced. The juice is
subacid and very palatable. The flowers are
ornamental, and sometimes are double. The rind
of the fruit and the bark of the roots possess
valuable medicinal properties. Consider for a
moment what nature has done for the support,
comfort and pleasure of the inhabitants of Tahiti,
and we are ready to admit the truth of what the
prince of poets said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is everything advantageous to life.</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we can answer with a positive yes the
question proposed by another famous poet, in the
beautiful stanza:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Know'st thou the land where the lemon trees bloom,</p>
<p>Where the gold orange glows in the deep thicket's gloom,</p>
<p>Where a wind ever soft from the blue heaven blows,</p>
<p>And the groves are of laurel and myrtle and rose?</p>
<p>GOETHE.</p>

<h1>THE FORESTS OF TAHITI</h1>
<p>The primeval forests are the pride of Tahiti.
Indirectly they are the wealth of the little island.
They have been spared the ravages of the
woodman's ax. The forests have been kind to the
natives and the natives to the forests. The
avaricious lumberman, the greatest enemy of public
wealth and general prosperity, has fortunately
so far not had a design on the magnificent
forests of Tahiti, and may he never be permitted to
carry on his work of destruction in this island
paradise! The giant trees, growing the finest and most
valuable timber, hold out much inducement to
get-rich-quick men, but they have been destined
for a better purpose; they, with the more
menial companions, the humble, lowly shrubs,
attract the clouds, determine rain, retain
moisture and fill the river-beds, creeks and rivulets
with the purest water. The forests extend from
the shore to near the highest mountain-peaks,
making up one great green sea of foliage,
interrupted here and there by the summits of hills,
ridges, and bare spots of brown, volcanic earth,
where vegetation of any kind has been forbidden
to take a foothold. Along and near the coast
are the charming groves of cocoa-palms, where
the ordinary trees, out of deference to the queen
of the tropic forests, are few and modest in their
ambition to compete with her in height. Here
the guava shrub, groaning under the weight of
its golden fruit, adds to the beauty of the grove.
A walk through such a grove, with glimpses of
the blue ocean and the verdant tree-clad hills
and mountains, will bring the conviction that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The groves were God's first temples.</p>
<p>BRYANT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Raising the eyes and looking up the steep
incline of the mountains clothed in perennial
verdure by a dense virgin forest, we are almost
instinctively reminded of the beautiful lines of
Dryden:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There stood a forest on the mountain's brow, which</p>
<p>overlook'd the shady plains below;</p>
<p>No sounding axe presumed these trees to bite, coeval</p>
<p>with the world; a venerable sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The forest in the tropics has no rest. From
one end of the year to the other, it appears the
same. There is no general disrobing at the
bidding of an uncompromising, stern winter.
There are no arctic chills to suffer and no burden
of snow to brave. Most of the trees are
evergreen, and the few that imitate the example of
their kind in the North by an annual change of
their leaves, perform this task almost
imperceptibly. There are no bald crowns and bare
arms. Spring, summer and autumn mingle
throughout the year; blossoming and ripe fruits
go hand in hand in the same tree or neighboring
trees. A walk through a tropic forest is no easy
thing, owing to the dense interlacing and often
prickly undergrowth, but the visitor is amply
rewarded for his efforts. Every step brings new
revelations, new surprises. Nowhere are there
any signs of deforestation, either by fire or the
cruel, thoughtless hand of man. You are in a
forest</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where the rude ax, with heaved stroke,</p>
<p>Was never heard the nymphs to daunt,</p>
<p>Or frown them from their hallow'd haunts.</p>
<p>MILTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest trees are in the shaded, rich
ravines and far up on the mountainside or
hill-tops. They seem to be conscious of their
superiority and power in the selection of their abode.
Look at one of these monsters, with wide-spread,
giant branches and impenetrable foliage, and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>View well this tree, the queen of all the grove;</p>
<p>How vast her bole, how wide her arms are spread.</p>
<p>How high above the rest she shoots her head!</p>
<p>DRYDEN.</p>

</div>
<p>But in these forests, so full of life and
perpetual activity, indications of death are seen here
and there. The numerous climbing vines which,
serpent-like, creep up and embrace in their
deathly grasp some young, vigorous tree, have
no good intentions for their patient, helpless host.
The struggle may last for years, but the ultimate
result is sure. The cruelty of the unwelcome
intruder increases with his age and, strength. The
fight for life becomes more and more intense.
The plant-serpent throttles its victim more and
more, penetrates its body with its additional
roots, and sucks the very life-blood from its
vitals. What promised to become the giant of
the forest sickens and succumbs to a slow,
lingering, ignominious death. The victory is
complete and he now stands with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pithless arms, like a wither'd vine,</p>
<p>That droops his sapless branches to the ground.</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ruthless climber has accomplished its
purpose and it has become so strong and has
made such intricate interlacements with
adjoining trees that it holds the corpse erect in its cold
embrace for an indefinite period of time, until
some strong wind lays low forever the victor
with the vanquished.</p>
<p>Like everywhere else where the soil is fertile
and other conditions for plant-growth favorable,
so in the Tahitian forest, rank plant-life prospers.
The lantana (Lantana Crocca) a shrubby plant
two to four feet high, with beautiful little yellow
and purple flowers arranged in umbels, has
overrun the whole island. It is here, as in some of the
other islands of the Pacific, the most aggressive
and most troublesome of all weeds, and it is
this plant which interferes with a more
abundant growth of grass and consequently with a
more productive pasturage in wild and cultivated
grounds.</p>
<p>The sense of isolation and solitude is nowhere
more profound than in a tropical forest, and
more especially so in Tahiti, as here animal life
is scarce. The only game found are domestic
hogs and chickens, which have run wild, and
these are scarce. There are no birds of plumage
and few song-birds. Chameleons frequent sunny
spots, and butterflies, of all sizes and colors,
enliven the air. There are no snakes and few
poisonous insects; no deer, bear, leopards or
monkeys. Even the ordinary water-birds, with
the exception of a small species of sea-gull and
occasionally a crane, seem to avoid this island.</p>
<p>A day spent in the wonderful forests of Tahiti
will bring no regrets; on the other hand, will be
replete with pleasure and profit, and will leave
charming pictures on memory's tablet which
time can never efface. On the brightest day,
darkness reigns underneath the almost
impenetrable roof of branches, vines and foliage. Here
and there the sun's rays penetrate through the
gigantic bowery maze, and fall upon the ground
with almost unnatural intensity, frequently
appearing and disappearing as the wind plays
with the leaves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind,</p>
<p>And make a checker'd shadow on the ground.</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solemn silence of the forest, the grandeur
of vegetation, the effects of light and shadows,
are impressive, and the visitor will carry away
from Tahiti an inspiring and lasting mental
picture of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her forests huge,</p>
<p>Incult, robust, and tall, by Nature's hand</p>
<p>Planted of old.</p>
<p>THOMSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="noted-forest-trees-of-tahiti">
<h1>NOTED FOREST TREES OF TAHITI</h1>
<p>The forests of Tahiti comprise many species
of trees, the timber of which would command a
high price in the market, but it is my intention
here to enumerate and briefly describe only a
few of the trees which interest the visitor the
most, as he will see them wherever he goes as
shade trees, and as component parts of the
magnificent forests.</p>
<p><em>Purau or Burao</em> is the <em>Hibiscus tiliaceus</em>
(Linné), (syn.: <em>Paritium tiliaceum</em>), order
<em>Malvaceæ</em>. The flowers are bell-shaped, of a
beautiful canary color, but quickly fall and turn to
red or reddish brown. They are made up of
five imbricated petals, painted a dark brown at
their base and inner surface. The glaucous
leaf-like calix is five-parted. The five stamens form
a sheath for the pistil, which is five-parted and
brown at its apex. The large leaves are used by
the native housewives in lieu of a table-cloth.
It is said that the macerated leaves and flowers
are used to heal burns, bruises, etc. (McDaniels).
The trunks of the largest trees are made into
canoes. The inner tough bark serves as a
substitute for hemp in the making of twine and
ropes. The roots of this tree have earned a
reputation as a valuable medicine in the
treatment of diseases of the gastro-intestinal canal.
This is a common and beautiful shade tree in
Papeete, and if the traveler visits the island in
January or February he will find it in full bloom.
The dark green leaves and the light yellow
flowers form a very pleasing contrast. It attains
a height of from forty to sixty and more feet.
The short and often very crooked stem sends off
numerous large branches, clothed, like the stem,
in a rough black bark. The branches are often
so crooked and tortuous that they form such an
intricate entanglement that even the woodman's
ax would meet with difficulties to isolate and
liberate them. The branches appear to have an
intrinsic tendency to reach the ground, and when
they do so strike root and become daughter trees,
growing skyward, and soon rival in height the
parent tree. In the woods it is not uncommon to
find the parent tree surrounded at variable
distances by numerous daughter trees. Many such
ambitious branches are formed into graceful
arches before they attain the wished-for
independence. This tree, with its numerous offspring
and interlacing branches, contributes much in
rendering the jungles in which it grows
impenetrable in many places. The wood is white and
soft. The leaves are as large as an ordinary small
soup-plate, long-petioled, seven-ribbed, broadly
cordate and acuminate, dark green and glossy
on their upper, and strongly veined and paler,
on their lower surface.</p>

<p class="caption">CASCADE OF FAUTAHUA</p>
</div>
<p><em>Banyan Tree</em>.—The <em>Ficus Indica</em>, a native tree
of India, remarkable for its vast rooting branches,
outstripping in this respect by far the tree just
described. It is a species of wild fig, has ovate,
heart-shaped, entire leaves, about five or six
inches long, and produces a fruit of a rich scarlet
color, not larger than a cherry, growing in pairs
front the axils of the leaves. The branches send
shoots downwards, which, when they have rooted,
become stems; the tree in this manner spreading
over a great surface, and enduring for many
years. The banyan tree found in the island of
Tahiti docs not spread as much as the Indian tree,
and the aerial roots which later become a part of
the trunk after they strike the ground and
develop an independent existence, become
supplied with new roots. Most of the aerial roots
of the Tahitian tree take their origin from the
lower part of the trunk and remain in close
contact with it after they strike the ground, and
many of them remain dangling free in the air
in vain attempts to secure an independent
existence, the branch roots being comparatively few.
The tree is found at short intervals along the
ninety-mile drive, and the largest one I saw was
in the front yard of the Cercle Bougainville, the
French club in Papeete.</p>
<p><em>Pandanus Tree, Screw Pine</em>.—The <em>Pandanus
Freycinctia</em> natural order of <em>Pandaneæ</em>. There
are about fifty species of this tree, natives of
South Africa to Polynesia. The pandanus tree
of Tahiti is a palm-like tree which is found along
the shore close to the water's edge, with a short
white stem, much branched with long, simple
imbricated leaves, usually spiny on the back and
margin, their base embracing the stem, their
spiral arrangement being well marked. The base
of the stem does not touch the ground, but rests
on a cluster of strong roots, which diverge
somewhat before they strike the soil. The leaves
are much used for thatch roofs and the thin,
compact, superficial layer serves as wrappers for the
native cigarettes. The fruit is edible and is eaten
by the natives in times of scarcity of food.</p>
<p><em>Flame Tree, Flamboyer</em>.—The <em>Brachychiton
acerifolium</em> is the Australian flame-tree
introduced, as is asserted, into Tahiti by Bougainville.
It is a magnificent and common shade tree in
Papeete, but is also found scattered all along the
coast of the island. It is an evergreen tree with
showy trusses of crimson flowers. This is the
most beautiful of all ornamental trees in the
island. The mucilaginous sap, when exuded,
indurates to a kind of bassarin—tragacanth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vanilla-cultivation-in-tahiti">
<h1>VANILLA CULTIVATION IN TAHITI</h1>
<p>The cultivation of the aromatic vanilla-bean is
one of the principal industries of Tahiti. The
bean grows luxuriantly in the shady forests in the
lowlands along the coast, and requires but little
care. The climate and soil of Tahiti are
specially adapted to the cultivation of the
vanilla-bean, as the very best quality is grown here. The
<em>Vanilla aromatica</em> is a genus of parasitic
<em>Orchidaceæ</em>, a native of tropic parts of America and
Asia, which springs at first from the ground
and climbs with twining stems to the height of
from twenty to thirty feet on trees, sending into
them fibrous roots, produced from nodes, from
which the leaves grow. These roots, drawing the
sap from the trees, sustain the plant, even after
the ground-root has been destroyed. Flower
white; corolla tubular; stigma distant from
anthers, rendering spontaneous fructification
difficult; leaves oblong, light green, fleshy, with an
exceedingly acrid juice; flowers in spikes, very
large, fleshy and generally fragrant. The fruit
is a pod-like, fleshy capsule, opening along the
side. The ripe bean is cylindrical, about nine
inches in length, and less than half an inch
thick. It is gathered before it is entirely ripe,
and dried in the shade. It contains within its
tough pericarp a soft black pulp, in which many
minute seeds are imbedded. The plant is
cultivated by cuttings. In Mexico and South
American countries, the insects effect
impregnation; in Tahiti, this is done artificially. With
a small, sharp stick the pollen is conveyed to
the stigma of the pistil. Artificial impregnation
of fifteen hundred flowers is considered a good
day's work. Allusion has been made elsewhere to
the fact that the shrewd Chinamen have
depreciated the vanilla industry in Tahiti and ruined
the reputation of the product. If the natives
could be induced to stop their dealings with the
scheming Chinese merchants and traders, and the
government would release them from export
duty, the cultivation of vanilla would soon
regain its former importance and would yield a
very profitable income. The Tahitians are not
agriculturists; they are averse to hard manual
labor; they are</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of proud-lived loiterers, that never sow,</p>
<p>Nor put a plant in earth, nor use a plough.</p>
<p>CHAPMAN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and hence are anxious to obtain what little money
they need with as little effort as possible. Vanilla,
once planted, requires very little attention, and
it grows most luxuriantly in the dark shadow of
the dense forest, where the natives engaged in
artificial impregnation of the flower and in
gathering the bean are protected against the direct
heat of the sun. The great advantage of
vanilla-cultivation to the island consists in the fact that
this valuable article of commerce can be grown
without deforestation, so essential in the
cultivation of much less valuable products of the soil
of the tropics.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-rural-districts">
<h1>THE RURAL DISTRICTS</h1>
<p>Papeete is not the place to study the natives,
their habits and customs, as European influence
and example have here largely effaced the
simplicity and charms of native life. The rural
districts are the places for the tourist to get
glimpses of real native life. He will find there
the best specimens of natives, and an opportunity
to study their primitive methods of living. There
is no other island of similar size where the
traveler will find it so easy to visit all of the
rural districts and villages. By following the
ninety-mile drive, he can encircle the entire
island in a comfortable carriage, and finish the
trip in four days, if his time is limited, and in
doing so he sees the inhabited part of the island
and nearly all of the villages. He will see on
this trip Paea Grotto and cave, also
picnic-grounds, eighteen miles from Papeete, Papara,
six miles further, is noted for native singing,
chanting and dancing. The real Tahitian life is
met at Pari and Tautira. On the other side of
the island, the road skirts along the coast and
ascends five hundred feet above the level of the
sea. The drive is a charming one, as the traveler
never loses the sight of mountains and hills, and
only very seldom, and at long intervals, of the
blue Pacific Ocean. In some places the road-bed
is cut through solid rock, and for a few moments
the panoramic view of the magnificent scenery
is shut out from sight, but on the other side of
the cut a picture more beautiful than ever is
unrolled. The ocean claims the first attention
as it smiles in the dazzling sunshine beneath
where</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The murmuring surge,</p>
<p>That on th' unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes.</p>
<p>Can not be heard so high.</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the distance we can see the foam-crested
waves dash over the coral reef in their attempts
to reach the placid waters of the peaceful lagoon,
where the wavelets play with the pebbles on the
shore. Looking toward the left, we again are
face to face with the mountains, that are our
constant companions, on the entire route. There
is a feeling of solemnity which takes possession
of the soul when communing with Nature in
her grandest mood, and we begin to feel that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I live not myself, but I become</p>
<p>Portion of that around me; and to me</p>
<p>High mountains are a feeling; but the hum</p>
<p>Of human cities, torture.</p>
<p>BYRON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see the naked mountain-peaks and the bare
backs of the foot-hills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun.</p>
<p>BRYANT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We pass through magnificent groves of
cocoa-palms, and now the road leads through a primeval
forest with an impenetrable jungle on its floor,
where</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The winds within the quiv'ring branches play'd,</p>
<p>And dancing trees a mournful music made.</p>
<p>DRYDEN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We pass through or near the quaint native
villages peopled with naked children, scantily
dressed women, and men whose only garment
consists of a much-checkered, many-colored calico
loin-cloth. We cross rivers, brooks and rivulets
without number, and looking for their source
we see glimpses, here and there, of cascades and
cataracts, high up on the mountainside, in the
form of streaks of silver in the clefts of the
deep green ocean of trees. We see butterflies
by the hundreds, of all colors, playing in the
sunshine or eagerly devouring the nectar of the
sweetest flowers. We admire the richness and
variety of the floral kingdom, and inhale the
perfume of the fragrant flowers, suspended in
the pure air and wafted to us by the cool land
breeze sent down from the top of the mountains.
As the sun approaches the horizon, and the short,
bewitching twilight sets in, with the gorgeous
display of colors in the sky and the wonderful
effects of light and shadow on sea and shore,
we can realize that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Softly the evening came. The sun from the western horizon</p>
<p>Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape;</p>
<p>Twinkling vapors arose; and sky, and water, and forest.</p>
<p>Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together.</p>
<p>LONGFELLOW.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vistas and views along this circular drive
are infinite; the surprises at every turn without
number. No matter how much the visitor may
have traveled, even if he has seen the whole
world outside of this blessed island, he will see
here many things he has never seen before.
Every step brings new revelations of the beauty
and goodness of Nature and her tender care for
man. What a paradise for lovers of nature,
for poets and artists! Here is a place above all
others in the world, where</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No tears</p>
<p>Dim the sweet look that Nature wears.</p>
<p>LONGFELLOW.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The further the visitor wends his way from
Papeete, the more he will find the natives in their
natural state, and the less contaminated by
European influence. On the opposite side of the
island, at Pari, the people have preserved their
native customs, and live now about in the same
manner as when Wallis discovered the island.
Religion and civilization have liberated them
from ancient barbarities, but have had little
influence in changing their customs, for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Custom has an ascendency over the understanding.</p>
<p>DR. I. WATTS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the villages scattered at short intervals
along the ninety-mile drive are small; the largest
with not more than five hundred inhabitants. In
Papeete, and between it and Papara, the natives
live in small frame houses, built on piling several
feet above the ground, covered with a roof of
corrugated iron, and made more spacious and
comfortable by a veranda facing the road. Few
native houses are encountered on this part of the
journey. Beyond Papara they are the rule, and
these retain their primitive charm. They are
built of upright sticks of bamboo, lashed side by
side to a frame of stripped poles in the form of
an oval. Upon this is a heavy roof of pandanus
thatch covering a cool, well-ventilated, sanitary
home. The air circulates freely through the open
spaces between the poles, as well as between the
two doorways on opposite sides of the house.
Mats take the place of a floor.</p>

<p class="caption">LAGOON AND REEF ON THE NINETY-MILE ROAD</p>
</div>
<p>Cooking is done outside without the use of a
stove. The native oven is a very simple affair,
as it consists of a layer of stones upon which a
fire is built. When heated to the requisite
degree—and this is a matter the experienced housewife
must determine—the food is placed amid the
embers, wrapped in pieces of banana leaves and
covered over with piles of damp breadfruit leaves.
Breadfruit, taro, green bananas and plantains,
are the articles of food prepared in this way.
The roasting of a pig, the favorite meat of the
South Sea Islanders, is a more complicated
process, and to do it well requires much experience.
A hole is dug in the ground and paved with
stones, upon which a fire is built. When the stones
are thoroughly heated and the fire exhausted or
extinguished, the whole animal, properly
prepared and wrapped in leaves, is placed in the
pit, covered with damp leaves and loose earth.
On great festive occasions, fowl and fish are
added to the contents of the pit. The pork, fowl
and fish cooked in this manner are delicious, and
the slightly smoky taste only adds to their
savoriness. It is the pride of the cook to remove the
roasted pig without mutilation, usually a very
delicate task. Chicken, boiled in the milk of the
cocoanut, is another masterpiece of native
cookery. The cocoanut is prepared in many ways for
the table and a sauce made of the compressed
juice of the grated nut, mixed with lime juice
and sea-water, makes a most palatable sauce for
meats and fish.</p>
<p>House-building and housekeeping are free
from care and never ruffle the family peace. If
a young couple desire to establish a home of their
own, they signify their intentions to their friends
and neighbors. These gather, usually Sunday
afternoon at two o'clock, at the place selected for
the new home, bring bamboo sticks, poles and
pandanus leaves, and at sundown the house is
ready for occupation. The pandanus roof does
efficient service for about seven years, when it
has to be removed and replaced by a new one.
The bamboo framework, properly protected, lasts
for a much longer time. As the whole house
consists of a single oval room, is floorless and not
encumbered by furniture of any kind, the
house-wife has an easy existence, more especially as
the children can not outwear their clothing, and
their husband's loin-cloths need no repairs.</p>
<p>While meat in Tahiti is scarce, every family
has an easy access to a rich fish-supply. The
fish which swarm in the lagoons and outside of
the reefs furnish an easily secured food-supply.
They are caught in different ways—by hook or
netting—and not the least picturesque way is the
torchlight fishing on the lagoon. Torches are
improvised of long cocoa-palm leaves tied into
rolls. With a boat-load of these, together with
nets and spears, the fishermen in their canoes
paddle out upon the water after dark. Flying
fish, attracted by the light, shoot overhead and
are dexterously caught in a hand-net. Other
kinds of fish, by aid of the light, are speared
over the side of the canoe. Dolphin and bonita,
the latter a favorite fish, are taken with the hook
and line, in larger canoes sailing on the open sea,
but this kind of fishing is left to a few hardy men.
The women scoop up small river-fish in baskets,
and drag-nets are used in capturing the many
varieties of small fish of the lagoon. While the
fish are being cooked in the underground oven,
some member of the family goes into the adjacent
forest and in a short time returns with
breadfruit, and a variety of fruits, to make up a dainty
and substantial repast.</p>
<p>The island is divided into seventeen districts
and each district has its own chief, who is
entrusted with the local government. The chiefs
are elected by popular vote every few years, the
office being no longer hereditary. The chief
resides in the principal village of his district and
here is to be invariably found a government
school, a Protestant and a Catholic church with
its respective parochial school, and a
meeting-house which serves as a gathering-place for the
annual native plays and on all occasions of public
concern. A daily mail supplies the rural
population with the news of the island and keeps them
in touch with the outside world. Abject poverty
in the city and country is unknown, and begging
is looked upon as a disgrace. There is neither
wealth nor poverty in Tahiti. The people have
all they need and all they desire, and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poor and content is rich, and rich enough.</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am quite sure that the tourist who has tasted
freely of modern life such as it now is in our
large cities, with all its cares and temptations,
all its unrealness and disappointments, when he
has seen the happy, contented, free-from-care
Tahitians, in their charming island and simple
homes, will be willing to confess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For my part, I should prefer to be always poor, in
blessings such as these.</p>
<p>HORATIUS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>

<div class="section" id="point-venus">
<h1>POINT VENUS</h1>
<p>Every visitor to Tahiti should visit Point
Venus, as it is a historic place near where the
Europeans made their first landings in Matavai
Bay, and where the first white settlers cast their
lot with the natives. It is in this neighborhood
where the English missionaries established their
permanent home and from here spread the new
tidings of the gospel over the entire island. They
labored in vain for nearly twenty years, when all
at once a religious wave swept over the island
which resulted in the speedy Christianization of
almost the entire population. I have already
referred to Point Venus as the place where the
government lighthouse is located and where
Captain Cook had his headquarters when he and
the scientists who accompanied him observed the
transit of Venus by order of the English
government in the year 1769. The place where the
scientific observations were made is marked by
a modest monument of stone surrounded by an
iron railing, on which are inscribed the data
commemorative of the work accomplished. Close
by this monument, on the most prominent point,
has been erected the lighthouse which guides
the mariner in approaching the island during
the night. The distance from Papeete to Point
Venus is seven miles, over a macadamized road
which we found in a somewhat neglected
condition. Two native villages, Pirae and Arue, are
passed on the way, and a third, Haapape, is close
by. The road leads through groves of
cocoa-palms, primeval forests and jungles, and a part
of it skirts the foot-hills of the towering
mountains. Most of the time the beautiful lagoon,
dotted here and there with fishermen's canoes,
is in sight. The calmness of the air, the solemnity
of the surroundings and the sight of these canoes
on the unruffled lagoon, reminded us of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Low stir of leaves and dip of oars</p>
<p>And lapsing waves on quiet shores.</p>
<p>WHITTIER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the more daring fishermen we saw
outside of the reef, in the same frail crafts,
battling with a rougher sea, but the skilled use
of their very primitive paddles kept the canoes
in good motion and steady, and it seemed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She walks the waters like a thing of life,</p>
<p>And seems to dare the elements to strife,</p>
<p>BYRON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matavai Bay, which the road follows for a
considerable distance, is a beautiful sheet of
water. It was in this bay that the ships of the
early voyagers found a resting-place, and where
on its shore the first white men touched the soil
of Tahiti and came face to face with a people
who had never heard of a world outside of the
islands of the Pacific. The scenery all along
this drive is truly tropical. The floral wealth
is great and its variety endless. It was on this
drive I found the passion-flower in full bloom
and exquisite beauty.</p>
<p>Near Point Venus we met a gang of natives,
in charge of the chief of the district, engaged
in repairing the road. All except the chief
were in loin-cloths as their only article of dress.
They worked leisurely, and smoked and chatted
in a way that showed that they were happy even
when bearing the burden of the day and the
scorching rays of the tropic sun, with nothing
in view for their ten-o'clock breakfast but the
cool mountain water instead of coffee, breadfruit
or plantain (<em>fei</em>) for bread, and some fruit
gathered in the woods on their way to work.</p>
<p>The round trip from Papeete to Point Venus
can be made in three hours, and gives one a very
excellent idea of the general topography of the
island and is replete with both pleasure and
profit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fautahua-valley">
<h1>FAUTAHUA VALLEY</h1>
<p>The next interesting short drive from Papeete
is to the Fautahua Valley, distance four miles.
It is noted for delightful river scenery and tropic
vegetation, and at the end of the valley is a
beautiful waterfall. This charming valley, with
its typical tropic scenery enclosed by towering
mountains and resounding with the rippling,
dashing music of a turbulent mountain stream
and the babbling and murmuring of the many
brooks and rivulets of pure crystal water which
feed it, is well worth a visit. This valley was
once densely populated, if we can judge from the
abundance of imported fruit trees and the coffee
shrub which now flourish in the forest unaided
by the care of man, while, at the present time,
the native huts are few and far apart. Wild
arrowroot grows here in profusion, and a variety
of exogenous shade trees have become an
important component part of the primeval forest,
rendered almost impenetrable by vines and a dense
undergrowth. A carriage-road extends to
Fashoda Bridge, well up in the mountains,
beyond which it leads up the gorge, past a waterfall
which leaps over a rocky rim, where the
mountains join to the bed of the stream, six hundred
feet below. In different places the romantic
mountain road is spanned by graceful arches of
branches of the pauru tree, ambitious to find on
the opposite side of the road an independent
existence from the parent tree. One of the large,
quiet pools below the Fashoda Bridge, a favorite
bathing-place for women and their daughters,
has been made famous by the writings of Pierre
Loti, a French author.</p>
<p>From Fashoda Bridge a bridle path leads up
a very steep incline to the French military post
in the very heart of the mountains, six thousand
feet above the level of the sea. It was here that
the natives made their last stand in their war
with France. A little beyond the fort rise the
crags which compose &quot;the Diadem,&quot; a
conspicuous landmark in the mountains of Tahiti.</p>
<p>The view from Fashoda Bridge in all
directions is inspiring: at the end of the gorge the
waterfall dashing over the volcanic rock,
pulverized at many points in its descent into silvery
spray; the tree-clad mountains on each side with
their steeples of bare rock; beneath, the wild
mountain stream, speeding to find rest in the
quiet basin below; and all around, the rank
vegetation which only the tropics under the most
favorable conditions can grow, and above, the
clear blue sky, brilliantly illuminated by the
morning sun. As late as nine o'clock in the
forenoon we found everything bathed in a heavy
dew, which added much to the beauty and
freshness of the incomparable scenery.</p>
<p>Near the bridge, leading a pack-mule, we met
a soldier on his way to the city for supplies
for the small garrison in charge of the fort.
Military duty at this lone isolated station must
certainly prove monotonous, as from the bridge
the only way to reach the fort is either on foot
or mule-back. The quietude of this peaceful
valley, at the time of our visit, was disturbed by
a large force of native laborers who were laying
the pipes for the new city waterworks.</p>

<div class="section" id="village-of-papara">
<h1>VILLAGE OF PAPARA</h1>
<p>The village of Papara, the largest in the
island, has been the acknowledged stronghold of
the Tevas for centuries. Here the powerful
chiefs of the clan have ruled their subjects with
an inborn sense of justice until their jurisdiction
and, power were curtailed by foreign
intervention. For a long time the ruling house of
the Tevas dominated the social and political life
of the island. It was at Papara that the largest
and most imposing marae was built, consisting
of a huge pile of stones in the form of a
truncated cone, the ruins of which still remain
as a silent reminder of the political power of
the Tevas lone before the white man cast his
greedy eyes upon this island paradise.</p>
<p>The district of Papara, of which the village
of about five hundred inhabitants is the seat of
the local government, is the most fertile and
prosperous of all the seventeen districts into
which the island is at present divided. Tati
Salmon, son of Ariitaimai, the famed chiefess
and historian of the island, is the present chief.
He was educated in London, is highly respected
by the foreigners and natives alike, and owns
about one-third of the island. He lives in a
charming old-fashioned house, the original part
of which was built more than a century ago. The
house is situated at the mouth of a large
mountain stream, and faces the broad lagoon hemmed
in by a coral reef, over which the surf dashes
from day to day and from year to year with the
same regularity, with the same splashing and
moaning sounds of the waves as they leap from
the restless ocean beyond into the peaceful bosom
of the calm lagoon.</p>
<p>Papara, like all of the native villages, is located
on the circular road familiarly known as the
ninety-mile drive. The road from Papeete to
Papara, a distance of twenty miles, leads through
the most picturesque and interesting part of the
island. The road is a genuine chaussee,
constructed at great expense by the French
government, and is kept in excellent repair. For the
most part it follows the coast in full view of the
lagoon and the ocean beyond, and, for more than
one-half of the distance, the smaller volcanic
sister island, Moorea, is in sight. The mountains
are constantly in sight, ceaselessly changing in
their aspects with distance and change of
perspective. The narrow strip of coast-land is
covered with a thick layer of the most productive
soil upon a foundation of rock and red volcanic
earth. Vegetation everywhere is rampant and
extends from the very edge of the lagoon to the
naked pinnacles of the mountains. In many
places the road skirts the foot-hills, and at
different points the precipitous mountains rise from
the bed of the lagoon, where the road-bed had to
be made by blasting away a part of their firm
foundation of volcanic stone.</p>
<p>The traveler on the whole trip is never without
the companionship of the branchless, slender,
graceful cocoa-palms, with their terminal crown
of giant leaves, clusters of blossoms, and nuts of
all sizes and stages of maturity. A stately forest
of cocoa-palms like those found on the coast of
Tahiti is a sight that can not fail to interest and
fascinate the Northerner fresh from zero weather,
snow and ice. The straight, columnar trunks,
with their sail-like terminal fronds and clusters
of fruit in all stages of development from the
blossom to the golden yellow of the ripe nut, are
objects of study and admiration which create in
the visitor a strong and lasting attachment for
the tropics. There is no other spot on the globe
where the tourist can see larger and more
beautiful palm forests than on the circular road
between Papeete and Papara. The cocoa-palm
is queen here, as there is no other tree among its
many neighbors that has succeeded in equaling
it in height. The lofty, proud head of the palm
has no competitor; it is alone in that stratum
of air and looks down upon the plebeian
trees beneath with a sense of superiority, if not
of scorn. For miles this road passes through
magnificent forests of cocoa-palms, with a heavy
undergrowth of guava, extending from the shore
high up the foot-hills and mountainsides. The
cocoa-palm is fond of salt water and thrives best
when its innumerable slender, long roots can
imbibe it from the briny shore.</p>
<p>The pandanus tree is even more partial to a
soil impregnated with salt water. On this drive
this tree is frequently seen, and in preference at
the very brink of the coast, with the butt-end of
the trunk high in the air, resting on a colonnade
of numerous powerful, slightly diverging roots.
Another tree omnipresent on this drive is the
pauru tree, with its large leaves and charming
cream-yellow, salver-shaped flowers. This tree
loves the dark, shady jungles, where its tortuous
branches mingle freely with the dense
undergrowth and climbing plants.</p>
<p>The views that present themselves on this drive
at every turn are simply bewitching and vary with
every curve of the road. The gentle ocean
breeze that fans the flushed face of the raptured
traveler is lost when the road leaves the coast
and plunges into a primeval forest, when</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gradual sinks the breeze</p>
<p>Into a perfect calm; that not a breath</p>
<p>Is heard to quiver through the closing wood.</p>
<p>THOMSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="caption">TAHITIAN CANOE WITH OUTRIGGER</p>
</div>
<p>As the carriage emerges from the dark shades
of the forest into the dazzling sunlight in full
view of the near-by ocean again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The winds, with wonder whist,</p>
<p>Smoothly the waters kiss'd,</p>
<p>Whispering new joys to the mild ocean.</p>
<p>MILTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every turn of the wheel on this winding road
brings new delights. The views of mountains
and ocean, the strange trees and flowers, the
childlike natives and their dusky, naked children,
the quaint villages, the turbulent mountain
streams and the diminutive cataracts and
waterfalls, framed in emerald green on the
mountain-sides, enchant the eye and stimulate the mind
every moment. These little waterfalls have
excavated the hardest rocks and have chiseled out,
in the course of centuries, crevices and caves of
the strangest designs.</p>
<p>The floral wealth of Tahiti is immense. Mr.
McDaniel, of Los Angeles, Cal., during a
several-months' visit to the island, analyzed and
classified two thousand different kinds of plants. Some
of the flowers are gorgeous, others yield a sweet
perfume which is diffused through the pure air,
imparting to it the balmy character for which it
has become famous. An acquaintance with these
flowers suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were I, O God, in churchless lands remaining,</p>
<p>Far from all voice of teachers or divines,</p>
<p>My soul would find, in flowers of thy ordaining,</p>
<p>Priests, sermons, shrines.</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a sudden turn of the road a vista is disclosed
that defies description. In the open roadway,
brilliantly illuminated by the noonday sun, in the
distance, a flame-tree, with its flowers of fire,
dazzles the eyes, and its grandeur and beauty
increase as we approach it, while, in a few
moments, what appeared as an apparition is
behind us, and the tension of vision is relieved by
a long, restful look over the limitless expanse of
the blue sea. I have seen the flame-tree in
different countries, but the sight of this one, with its
magic surroundings, made a picture of exquisite
beauty which forcibly recalled the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spreading branches made a goodly show,</p>
<p>And full of opening blooms was ev'ry bough.</p>
<p>DRYDEN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The numerous villages of land-crabs met on
this drive afford amusement for the stranger,
unfamiliar with this inhabitant of the coast in
the tropics. The land-crabs have evidently a
well-organized government in each community.
Among the most important officials are the
sentinels, who are always on duty, when the
inhabitants of the village have left their underground
habitations, to give timely notice of impending
danger. With the approach of man, the whole
colony is on the alert. As a matter of safety,
the land-crab does not stray far away from its
subterranean home. When these animals are out
in the open they are never caught napping. Their
large, exophthalmic eyes are never idle, and the
instant danger threatens they speed to their place
of safety. If you have enough patience to wait,
you will find, sooner or later, two large staring
eyes on a level with the hole where the animal
disappeared. The land-crab is cautious,
constantly on the lookout, and, on the first signal of
danger, makes a rush for his or somebody else's
hole.</p>
<p>A short distance from Papeete is a truck
garden managed by Chinamen. This enterprise, the
only one I noticed on the drive, demonstrates well
what the soil of Tahiti is capable of producing
in the way of growing vegetables. It is an ideal
vegetable garden, weedless, and verdant with all
kinds of vegetables. The foreign population of
the city is supplied from here with lettuce,
asparagus, cabbage, sweet potatoes, carrots, onions,
turnips and melons of the choicest quality. The
natives have no use for vegetables and make no
attempts to raise them for the market. The
guava shrub is found everywhere. It has infested
the country, weed-like, and its golden fruit is not
appreciated by the natives; only a very small part
of the fruit is gathered for making jelly, one of
the few articles of export.</p>
<p>This is the part of the island where the
vanilla-bean is most extensively cultivated. A vanilla
plantation is a jungle in which the bean thrives
best. In the thick woods all along the road, the
climbing bean is seen trailing up the shrubs and
trees, often to a height of twenty feet. At the
time of my visit the blossoms had disappeared
and the green beans had reached a length of
about four inches, half their length when they are
ripe. A patient and prolonged search made for
a flower was finally rewarded by the finding of a
belated bud which, on being placed in water,
expanded into a flower during the night, affording
me an opportunity to study its anatomy.</p>
<p>Three small villages, Faaa, Punaauia and Paea,
are passed on the way from Papeete to Papara,
and, like all other villages, each of them had
its own government school, a Catholic and a
Protestant church, and, connected with these, two
parochial schools. The compulsory education
introduced into the island applies to children from
six to sixteen years of age. The churches are
well attended, but I was informed by a German,
who has resided in Tahiti for thirty years, that
the people attend service more as a matter of
amusement than with any intention of obtaining
spiritual benefit.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the village shops are kept by
Chinamen, and it is needless to say that these
shrewd foreigners take undue advantage of the
simple, trusting natives, in all of their business
transactions. Much of the hard-earned money of
the natives finds its way into the capacious
pockets of these enterprising Orientals.</p>
<p>We reached Papara toward evening, and, when
we came in sight of the chiefery, were deeply
impressed with the beauty of the location. Palm
trees, flowering shrubs and garden flowers adorn
the spacious grounds in front and all around the
ancient mansion which is perched on an elevated
plateau adjoining the large and beautiful stream
of crystal mountain water, and facing the placid
lagoon. An immense double war-canoe was at
anchor in the river. It is now used as a
fishing-boat by one of the sons of the chief, when he
desires to catch the bonita outside of the lagoon.
It takes seven men to manage this giant canoe,
by means of paddles.</p>
<p>In front of the wide veranda of the one-story
house is an ornamental tree which spreads its
branches at least twenty feet in all directions.
As it was in full bloom at the time of my visit,
it added much to the beauty and comfort of the
immediate surroundings in front of the house.</p>
<p>The rooms of the mansion are large, and
brimful of local antiquities and old furniture imported
from Europe, which impart to them a coziness
and charm which have been greatly appreciated
and gratefully remembered by many a welcome
visitor. It is in a house like this, presided over by
the chief of Papara and his charming family, that
one can experience what genuine, unselfish
hospitality means.</p>
<p>Twelve servants, men and women, take
care of the house, the family and the visitors.
Most of these were born on the place, and some
of them, very old now, were in the service of the
grandfather of the present chief. The relation
between master and servants in this house is a
very pleasant one. The servants are looked upon
and treated rather as relatives than employes.
Their pay is small, but they are given all the
comforts of a home.</p>
<p>Word had been sent ahead from Papeete
announcing our visit, for the purpose of securing
for us the rare pleasure of partaking of a
genuine native dinner. A little pig was roasted
underground, and chickens were boiled in the
milk of the cocoanut, exquisite dishes, which,
with excellent coffee, French bread, and a variety
of luscious tropical fruit, made up a dinner which
it would be impossible to duplicate in any of the
large cities of the continents.</p>
<p>The village of Papara is a most interesting
place to visit. Besides the magnificent scenery,
one finds here many native huts, and the town
hall is a large, airy structure, built of bamboo
sticks and covered with a thatched roof. Near
the village are the grotto and cave, which enjoy
a local reputation, and are well worth seeing by
the visitor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:</p>
<p>At one stride conies the dark;</p>

<p>Off shot the spectre bark.</p>
<p>COLERIDGE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day had been hot and sultry. From a
cloudless sky, the tropical sun shot down, without
mercy, his arrows of heat, against which the
lightest and most porous headdress, umbrella,
roof and shade afforded but inadequate protection.
Man and beast were listless, perspiring, careful
to make no unnecessary exertion. The green,
succulent foliage bowed under the oppressive
heat, and even the gayest of the flowers drooped
their proud heads in homage to the fierce
king of the serene blue sky. The very
atmosphere quivered in convulsive movements,
and the intense light, reflected from the surface
of the sleeping ocean and the white city, dazzled
and blinded those who ventured to go out into
the streets. The little capital city of Papeete,
nestled on the plateau between the harbor and
the foot of towering mountains, half hidden
among the tropic trees, was at rest; market and
streets deserted, business houses closed, and the
wharf silent and lifeless. The numerous
miserable curs in the streets sought shelter in the shade,
lying in a position affording most perfect
relaxation, with protruded, blue, saliva-covered tongues,
fighting the heat by increasing the respiratory
movements to the utmost speed. The
numerous half-wild pigs in the streets, with paralyzed
tails and relaxed bristles, buried themselves as
deeply as possible in the nearest mud-pool, and
with eyes closed, submitted passively to the fiery
rays of the midday sun. The roaming chickens,
from bald chicks a few days old to the ruffled,
fatless veterans of questionable age, suspended
their search for rare particles of food with which
to satisfy their torturing sense of hunger, and
simply squatted where the heat overcame them,
in the nearest shady place, there to spend the
enforced siesta with bills wide open and the dry,
blue tongues agitated by the rapid and violent
breathing. The birds of the air ceased their frolic;
their song was silenced, and they took refuge in
trees with thickest foliage. Men, women and
children, rich and poor, merchant and laborer,
were forced to suspend work and play, and seek,
in the shadow of their homes or near-by trees,
protection against the onslaught of the burning
rays of the sun. Such is the victory of the sun
of the tropics. He demands unconditional
surrender on the part of every living thing. He
knows no compromise, as he is sure of victory as
long as his victim is in a favorable strategic
position. This was the case on the day of which I
speak. As the rays of the sun became more and
more oblique, and the invisible great fan of the
land-breeze was set in motion, wafting down
from the high mountain peaks a current of cool
air, the city woke up from its midday slumber.
The sun had lost his fiery power. He was
retreating from the field of combat, and
approaching in the distance the rim of the placid ocean.
The monarch of the day, so near his cool, watery
couch, laid aside his mask of fire and smiled
upon the vanishing world with a face beaming
with happiness and peace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sun was set, and Vesper, to supply</p>
<p>His absent beams, had lighted up the sky.</p>
<p>DRYDEN.</p>
<p>It was an evening bright and still</p>
<p>As ever blush'd on wave or bower,</p>
<p>Smiling from heaven, as if naught ill</p>
<p>Could happen in so sweet an hour.</p>
<p>MOORE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last act of the retiring monarch of the day
revealed his incomparable skill as a painter.
He showed discretion in the selection of the time
to demonstrate to the best advantage his
matchless artistic skill. He chose the evening hour,
when the soul is best prepared to take flight from
earthly to heavenly things. He waited until man
and beast had laid aside the burden and cares of
the day, and were in a receptive, contemplative
mood to study and appreciate the paintings
suspended from the paling blue dome of the sky.</p>
<p>He waited until he could hide himself from view
behind the bank of fleecy clouds moving lazily in
the same direction. Then he grasped the
invisible palette charged with colors and tints of
colors unknown to the artists of this world, and
seized the mystic, gigantic brush when</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The setting sun, and music at the close.</p>
<p>As the last taste of sweets is sweeted last,</p>
<p>Writ in remembrance more than things long past.</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The time for this magic work was short. The
moment the passing clouds veiled his face it
began. From the very beginning it became
apparent that the hidden artist exhibited
superhuman skill. The most appreciative and
scrutinizing of his admirers felt powerless to
comprehend and much more to give a description of the
panoramic views which he painted with such
rapid succession on the sky, clouds and the dull
surface of the dreamy, listless ocean. With
intense interest we watched the constantly varying,
artistic display, felt keenly the shortcomings of
human art, and realized, to the fullest extent, the
force and truth of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who hath not proved how feebly words essay</p>
<p>To fix one spark of beauty's heavenly ray.</p>
<p>BYRON.</p>

</div>
<p>All painters place the greatest importance upon
a proper background for their pictures in order
to give light and shade a strong expression. So
does the sun. With a few strokes of the magic
brush, the deep blue of the horizon was wiped
out and replaced by the palest shade of blue, so
as to bring forth, in bolder relief, the resplendent
colors on the moving canvas of the clouds. The
artist fringed the margins of the clouds with
delicate lace of shining gold. Through clefts
and rents in the clouds the smiling face of the
painter peeped upon the beautiful evening
beyond. His work had only begun. In rapid turns
the clouds were converted into a sheet of gold
with a violet border that deepened into a vivid
crimson hue. As the artist disappeared, inch by
inch, under the limitless expanse of the ocean,
he wiped out the brilliant colors on the canvas of
clouds, and gilded the horizon with a sheet of
gold, deepening his favorite color, yellow, into an
orange hue, which remained unchanged until the
approaching darkness threw a drapery of sombre
black over the inspiring scene. Twilight shuns
the tropics. Day lapses into night almost
imperceptibly, and, with the setting of the sun, the
earth is wrapped in darkness. There is no
compromise in the tropics, between the rulers of day
and night. With the disappearance of the last
rays of the sun, the pale blue dome of the sky is
decorated with millions of flickering stars,
casting their feeble light upon land and sea through
the immeasurable ethereal medium which
separates heaven from earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sun has lost his rage; his downward orb</p>
<p>Shoots nothing now but animating warmth</p>
<p>And vital lustre.</p>
<p>THOMSON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the evening of which I speak, the short
twilight foreshadowed the appearance of the
heavenly advance-guard proclaiming the coming
of the Queen of Night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the evening King gave place to night,</p>
<p>His beams he to his royal brother lent,</p>
<p>And so shone still in his reflected light.</p>
<p>DRYDEN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking in the direction opposite from where
the monarch of the day had disappeared, the
cloudless sky brightened over the bare gray
mountain-peak, and the stars, in joyful
anticipation of the approaching event, abandoned their
stoic immobility and trembled in feverish
excitement. An impressive silence reigned in the little
city, broken now and then by the almost
noiseless footsteps of half-naked, barefoot natives, or
the clattering of the hoofs of a horse and
humming of the wheels of a passing cart, and, once
or twice, by the whirr of the only automobile in
the island, steered by an enterprising, prosperous
French merchant.</p>
<p>Nature awoke from her noonday slumber, the
glossy leaves resumed their natural shape and
freshness, the drooping flowers revived,
expanded and exhaled their fragrance, perfuming
the evening air. The birds had found shelter and
protection for the night in the leafy domes of
the many beautiful shade and ornamental trees.
It was solemn eveningtide, when the heart of
man is most receptive for noble and pure
impressions. It was the time to turn away the thoughts
from the busy, selfish world and reflect upon the
wonders of creation. It was the time to look
upward to the calm, pale, blue sky, feebly
illuminated by the soft light of countless tiny lamps
suspended by invisible cords from the limitless
space above. It was the time to look beyond
earthly things. It was the time to understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The beauty of the world and the orderly arrangement
of everything celestial makes us confess that there is
an excellent and eternal nature, which ought to be
worshiped and admired by all mankind.</p>
<p>CICERO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were speechless spectators of the passing
and coming. Our thoughts were turned to the
invisible hand that created the earth we inhabit
and all of the heavenly bodies, and which directs
their movements with infallible precision and
unfailing regularity. We thought of things
incomprehensible to man, of things far beyond the
grasp of the human mind, of things known only
to the Almighty Lord, Creator of all things in
heaven and earth.</p>
<p>With our eyes fixed on the gateway of entrance
of the Queen of Night, we patiently awaited her
arrival, anxious, however, to catch the first
glimpse of her beautiful face. No blare of
trumpets or bugle call announced her approach. She
rose in the sky silently, resplendent in her own
magic beauty, and her charms are always
sweetest when the nights are calm and peaceful. She
combined beauty with two of the most attractive
feminine virtues—modesty and gentleness. As
we watched her regal entrance into the sky, the
golden arch assumed the deep yellow hue of the
precious metal it resembled, and, in a few
moments, the pale rim of her sweet face rose over
the dark, bald mountain-peak, and ascended
slowly and majestically, higher and higher, away
from earthly things, on her journey through the
pathless sky. This evening she appeared in
perfect glory, permitting us to look into her full,
calm face. Her consort, the sun, had just
disappeared, leaving behind him a golden crescent
on the opposite horizon. She was following his
pathway and had taken possession of his throne
for the night. The departing sun and the
ascending moon were in strange and pleasing
contrast at the threshold of that beautiful night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O! belle nuit! mit preferable au jour!</p>
<p>Premier nuit a amour consacree!</p>
<p>En sa faveur, prolonge ta duree,</p>
<p>Et du soleil retarde le retour.</p>
<p>DE MALFILATRE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moon loves to reign in peace and quietude.
She abhors the tumult of the battle-field and the
struggles of man for wealth and honor. She is
the friend of the wounded, the sick and the poor;
and the guardian angel of all those in need of
repose. As she ascended heavenward, the
rippling ocean became a great mirror, a mirror
worthy to reflect her beautiful face. The soft,
pale light streaming out from the silvery orb
cast phantom-like shadows in the forests, parks
and streets. Solemnity reigned supreme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On seas, on earth, and all that in them dwell,</p>
<p>A death-like and deep silence fell.</p>
<p>WALLER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy the people who respect and love the
Queen of Night and her reign of peace and rest!
Charming Queen! Retard your journey,
prolong your peaceful mission for the well-being of
your loyal subjects so much in need of your
calming influence and of your soft, soothing
light! To such petitions the goddess of the sky
has only one inflexible reply: &quot;The universe is
my kingdom, the earth you live in is only one
of my smallest possessions. I must remain loyal
to all of my realms.&quot;</p>

<p>This evening in Tahiti had another and still
more sublime entertainment in store for us, a
spectacle which can be seen in perfection only in
the tropics, and, I imagine, Tahiti is the stage
more perfect than any other in the world for the
display of one of nature's grandest exhibitions.
The soft light of the rising moon and the myriads
of tiny, flickering stars furnished the
illumination; the mountains, forests, harbor and ocean, the
stage. We were roused from our reverie by
distant peals of thunder. Looking in the
direction whence these reports came, we saw black,
angry clouds hovering about the mountain-peaks
to the south and east of Papeete. The clouds
were too heavy for the rarified mountain air and
soon began to descend slowly but steadily until
they wrapped the towering summits in a cloak
of sombre black. The mountain-peaks, which
but a short time before were caressed by the
gentle, silvery light of the moon, were now
completely obscured. Where did these clouds come
from? No one could tell. No one could
mistake their movements. They appeared to have
had only one object in view, and that was to
embrace the mountain-range well below the
tree-line. Smaller clouds, fragments from the main
mass, moving more swiftly in the evening air,
impelled by the land-breeze, floated away from
the dark wall enveloping the mountainsides,
which seemed to possess some subtle, magnetic
power buried in the Immense piles of volcanic
rocks. At short intervals, great zigzag chains of
lightning shot through these dark clouds,
momentarily lighting up the dark, unbroken,
primeval forest. These dazzling, blinding flashes of
lightning were in strong contrast with the soft,
tropic moonshine that remained outside of the
limits of the aerial sea of clouds, which had
commenced to discharge a drenching rain. Fleecy
little wandering clouds now flecked the horizon,
strangely and variously painted by the
moonlight, shortly before the midnight hour. Through
fissures in these fleeting, snowy clouds, the moon
and stars often peeped at the grand spectacle
which was being enacted on the stage below.
Lightning and thunder came nearer and nearer
with the approach of the weeping mass of clouds.
The bolts of lightning must have found their
marks with unerring precision in the crags and
forest underneath the roof of dense clouds, as
from there came at short intervals deafening
peals of thunder reverberating through the calm
evening air far out over the surface of the
sleeping ocean, where the reverberations died out
in a faint rumbling.</p>
<p>This majestic but awesome sight was of short
duration. The pouring rain relieved the clouds
of their abnormal weight, and, balloon-like, they
rose, clearing the mountain-range, which then
again made its appearance in the soft, bewitching
moonlight of the tropics. Lightning and thunder
retreated with the disappearance of the clouds.
The atmosphere was cool and refreshing, purified
by the pouring rain and the furious electric storm.
At this stage of the nightly display in our
immediate vicinity, in front of the veranda of the little
hotel, in full view of the now deserted stage,
from the clear, cloudless sky, gigantic drops of
rain fell, sparkling in the magic moonlight like
diamonds that had become loosened and had
fallen from the jeweled crown of the Queen of
Night, whose throne had then reached the zenith
of the horizon.</p>
<p>Instead of wishing for an encore after such a
brilliant act given by nature's artists, we took
one more and last look at the serene, smiling, full
face of the moon, and were then prepared to
acknowledge reverently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What else is nature but God, and divine reason,
residing in the whole world and its parts.</p>
<p>SENECA.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="iorana">
<h1>IORANA!</h1>
<p>The South Sea Islanders have beautiful words
of welcome with which they meet the stranger.
The Samoan greets you with <em>talofa</em>; the
Hawaiian, with a clear, musical voice, welcomes you
with <em>aloha nui</em>; and the Tahitian, with an open,
friendly face and a smile, when he meets you,
addresses you with that beautiful greeting,
<em>iorana</em>. These euphonious words mean more
than the words of our language intended for the
same purpose; they come from the heart and are
addressed to the heart much more so than our
&quot;Welcome,&quot; &quot;How do you do?&quot; &quot;How are you?&quot;
or &quot;I am glad to see you.&quot; These Polynesian
words are not only words of welcome, but carry
with them the best wishes of the natives for the
stranger; they signify not only a formality, but
also express a sincerity which is so often lacking
in our conventional meetings with friends and
strangers. The visitor who remains long enough
in Tahiti to become acquainted with the natives
will find that their greeting, <em>iorana</em>, is verified
by their actions. The natives, educated and
ignorant, young and old, are polite, friendly and
hospitable to a fault. They are fond of making
little gifts to strangers, and if these are
reciprocated, they are really and honestly grateful.
The people are charming, the island beautiful,
and nature's storehouse never empty of the
choicest that the sea can supply and the soil
can produce. Any one who has seen Tahiti, the
Island Paradise, on leaving it, and ever after,
in recalling his experiences and observations in
this island of peace, rest, charms and pleasures,
will give expression to his feelings by repeating
to himself.</p>

<p>I wish peace, and any terms prefer</p>
<p>Before the last extremities of war.</p>
<p>DRYDEN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one of the far-off isles of the South Seas,
in the garden-spot of the Pacific, in golden
Tahiti, about the year 1848, when Victoria was
a young queen and mother, when France was in
the throes of a second revolution, when the
United States, a young republic, was still on trial
before the old world, there was enacted one of
the most touching dramas history has ever
recorded, and this among a people considered
savages by the so-called civilized world, and
almost unknown until discovered through the
missionary fervor of a few priests. The place,
a small island, only a speck on the map; the
<em>dramatis personæ</em>, France, England and
America, the hereditary chiefs of a people who for
forty generations had known no other rulers,
a weak, vacillating native queen, and a
noble-hearted native woman who knew how to be at
the same time a loyal subject, a skilled diplomat,
and that rarer and more beautiful thing, a
faithful friend. If you would hear a story of
friendship pure and undefiled, listen to the story of
Ariitaimai of Papara, a Tahitian of noble birth,
a child of Nature in its wildest and grandest
aspect, rocked in a gigantic cradle of sea, sky
and towering mountains, in a land of palm
forests, where Nature has provided everything
necessary to the life of her children, and where
the pearls are the purest. If Cicero had known
the story of Ariitaimai he would not have
written in <em>De Amicitia:</em> &quot;But where will you find
one who will not prefer to friendship, public
honors and power, one who will prefer the
advancement of his friend in public office to
his own? For human nature is too weak to
despise power.&quot; But to understand this
thrilling and eventful drama, we must listen first to
the chorus reciting something of the history of
this strange people, and of the position of
woman in a land where suffrage societies are
unknown, and where the story of the inequality
of the sexes had never been told by book or
priest. Tahiti, Matea and Moorea are known
as the Windward Islands of the Society Group
in the South Seas. The Leeward Islands
comprise the four kingdoms, Huahine, Borabora,
Raiatea and Tahaa, together with some smaller
islands, and are about one hundred and twenty
miles from Tahiti. But it has always been in
Tahiti, the gem of the Pacific, that the interest
has been centered, and it was here that the
struggle took place between the English and
the French for supremacy in the South Seas.</p>

<p>It was in 1769 that Captain Cook entered
Matavai Bay on his first voyage to observe the
transit of Venus. This spot is marked by a
stone monument and has been known ever since
as Point Venus. At this time Cook estimated
the number of inhabitants at two hundred
thousand. To-day, after the long contention between
the French and English for supremacy, after
the brave struggle of the natives against both
for independence, after all the ravages made by
the diseases introduced by foreigners, and
after years of a fearful mortality caused by the
enervating effect of civilization upon a people
suited only to be children of Nature, this goodly
number has been reduced to a pitiful eleven
thousand. In fact, our so-called nineteenth
century civilization has succeeded in practically
exterminating a people who could produce a
pearl among womankind, a rare and tender
soul, such an one as English history does not
give us, and France has produced but one, her
own Jeanne D'Arc.</p>
<p>The government of the island has always been
by chiefs and chiefesses, no distinction of sex
being made in laws of inheritance, the eldest
born inheriting the rank and estates and all the
authority which the title of chief conveys.
Many of the chiefesses appear to have been
exceedingly warlike, true Amazons, contending
with neighboring chiefs for more authority and
extensive possessions. Even as wives of the
chiefs, women went to war to help fight the
battles of their husbands and clans. It is
reported of one of the Pomares who was of a
peaceful disposition that in one hotly contested
encounter he fled to a neighboring island,
leaving his wife Iddeah to face the storm. History
says that she was a great warrior and carried
the contest to a successful issue for her husband
and their possessions. It is recorded of another
chief that he was not a warrior and left the
active campaigning to his wife. So it will be
seen that in the political life of Tahiti sex was
not considered. Accident of birth settled the
title, and the warlike spirit miade the warrior,
whether it resided in chief or chiefess. England
took a hand in the island politics at a time when
one of the weakest and most unpopular chiefs
was warring for the supremacy, and by assisting
and upholding his authority prolonged one of
the most disastrous wars in the history of Tahiti.
The Tahitians detested tyranny and the
insolence of a single ruler, and in their tribal system
of chiefs had a protection against despotism
which the foreigners, by their advocacy of the
cause of a special chief, afterwards Pomare I.,
destroyed.</p>
<p>Before the invasion of the English, the
hereditary chief of each district held absolute sway
in his own province. Questions of common
interest were settled in the island councils by
majority vote, and it was in these deliberations
that the chiefs of Papara had for generations
held the balance of political power. Politically,
the change was disastrous. In olden times
whenever a single chief became arrogant and
threatened to destroy the rest, all the others united to
overthrow him and thus re-established the
political equilibrium.</p>
<p>Ariitaimai belonged to the Clan of Tevas, of
the chiefery of Papara, and the family of Tati.
She belonged to the clan which was ruled by
Opuhara, the last of the heathen chiefs who
went down in the conflict with Pomare II.,
who with the help of English guns was made
absolute monarch of the island. This conflict
between Opuhara and the English, because
Pomare was only an instrument in their hands
to accomplish the conquest of the island, is
responsible for the bitter hatred of the genuine
natives for the foreigners and the missionaries.</p>
<p>Opuhara was considered the greatest warrior
and hero of the Tevas, and his death, the result
of a stratagem on the part of Pomare and the
English missionaries, is considered by his people
a veritable assassination. He fell by a shot fired
by a native missionary convert. Tati, one of the
under-chiefs of Papara, had been persuaded by
the English to approach Opuhara to negotiate
with him for submission. But Opuhara turned
on him with scorn. &quot;Go, traitor,&quot; he said;
&quot;shame on you! you, whom I knew as my eldest
brother, I know no more; and to-day I call this
my spear, 'Ourihere,' brotherless. Beware of it,
for if it meet you hereafter, it meets you as a foe.
I, Opuhara, have stood as Arii in Mona Temaiti,
bowing to no other Gods but those of my fathers.
There I shall stand to the end; and never shall
I bow to Pomara or to the Gods forced on us
by the white-faced man.&quot; With Opuhara
perished the last hope of the native patriots to
preserve a government of chiefs. His dying
words were all that was left to his clan of the
glory and power of Papara. &quot;My children,
fight to the last! It is noon, and I, Opuhara,
the <em>ti</em> of Mona Temaiti, am broken asunder!&quot;
He fell a martyr to his belief in the heathen
gods, and in the ancient inherited rights of his
people: a tribal government. His followers
have always firmly believed that Opuhara would
have won the contest had not the missionaries
brought their guns along with their Bibles.</p>
<p>It was this belief that Ariitaimai inherited
with the beautiful lands of Papara. She says in
her memoirs: &quot;I am told that Opuhara's spear,
'Brotherless Ourihere,' is now in the Museum
of the Louvre. Even in those days there were
among all his warriors only two who could
wield it. If the missionaries have sometimes
doubted whether the natives rightly understood
the truths and blessings of Christianity, perhaps
one reason may be that the Tevas remember how
the missionaries fought for Pomare and killed
Opuhara.&quot;</p>
<p>Marama, the mother of Ariitaimai, was a
celebrated chiefess in her own right, the sole
heir of Marama, the head chief of Moorea, the
nearest island to Tahiti. She was a great heiress,
and the last representative of the sacred families
of these two islands. She was given in
marriage, as a political compromise and at the
special request of King Pomare, to Tati's son, the
head chief of Tahiti. It was also agreed that
all issue of the marriage should become the
adopted children of Pomare, according to an
ancient Tahitian custom. The family is a great
institution in Tahiti and any one whose parents
both by birth and adoption had been carried to
the family Marae with offerings to the gods,
enjoyed a rare social distinction. This
Ariitaimai could claim, so from her birth she was
looked upon by the islanders as an especially
favored and much-to-be-treasured maiden. It
may be that this great respect shown towards
her by the entire people did much to mold her
character. The Tahitian mother has little to say
in regard to the training of her first-born, as
this one is considered to belong to the family
as a whole, and all questions of general interest
are settled in family council. And so it was
with Ariitaimai. She saw little of her mother,
but was in constant touch with the family chiefs
from whom, no doubt, she learned lessons in
diplomacy, and from listening to their councils
she acquired that rare good judgment which
fitted her later to be the accepted advisor of her
teachers. She mastered both the French and
the English languages, and her memoirs show
a wonderful knowledge of the literature of both
countries, as well as a wide and comprehensive
reading of classical authors. While Ariitaimai
was growing to womanhood, the pride and
special care of the chiefs of Papara, another maiden
was receiving equal care and attention on a
neighboring island. Aimata of Raiatea, the
daughter of Pomare II., was only nine years
old when her father died and she was given into
the care of the head chief Uata, who was a good
and learned man.</p>

</div>
<p>These two young girls who were destined to
play such an important rôle in the history of
their country, grew up under much the same
influences and developed characters as widely
different as the antipodes. They saw each other
only occasionally until Aimata's mother sent one
day for Ariitaimai to make a long visit at the
royal castle, as was the custom among the
islanders, as Pomare had claimed her as his
adopted daughter according to the ante-natal
contract. Here blossomed and grew the
friendship which was destined later to save to Pomare
IV. her throne, and to deliver Tahiti from a war
which could only have resulted in the
extermination of the native population and the destruction
of the island as an independent government. The
real struggle between France and England for
the possession of the island began in 1836, when
two French priests landed at Tahiti to convert
not the pagans to Christianity but Protestant
Christians to the Roman faith. Aimata now
become Pomare IV., promptly ordered their
arrest and expulsion. The French priests made
a protest to their government and Louis Philippe
sent a frigate to Papeete, the harbor city, with
an ultimatum, and the Queen was obliged to
yield. The English consul and the missionaries
contested the occupation of the French, and
another frigate was sent to Tahiti. Queen
Pomare now appealed to Queen Victoria and
offered to submit to a British protectorate. She
also sent a protest to the government of the
United States, against allowing the French to
forcibly occupy Tahiti. But the English Queen
was busy with more important home affairs, and
neglected the appeal from the little island so far
away, and the protest to the United States was
apparently ignored. By a lack of appreciation
of the Queen's communication, the United States
lost the control of the gem of all the Pacific
isles, and lost also a rare opportunity to aid
and protect a brave people in their struggle for
independence. This attitude of England and the
United States left the contest to be settled
between the natives and the French. After a
desultory war lasting over four long, miserable
years, with the advantage first on one side and
then on the other, the French government decided
to end the matter and sent two frigates to the
island. The government had offered previously
to this to place Pomare permanently on the
throne under a French protectorate, but she
would not consent to this, looking constantly for
help from the English who had done so much
for her father. So she left Tahiti, the scene of
the contest, and fled to Raiatea to her own
family for protection, while waiting for the help
which never came.</p>
<p>Ariitaimai, in her own beautiful home at Papara,
pondered over the wretched state of her beloved
country and her heart was sore both for her
idolized friend and poor bleeding Tahiti. Was
there no way out of this Slough of Despond into
which the foreigners had plunged her unhappy
country? She knew the temper of the island
chiefs and that they had sworn to die fighting
for the independence of their country. She
remembered the fate of Tati, who had been
branded a traitor with Opuhara's last breath
because he counseled submission to the English,
and she dared not propose to them any
compromising measures. She looked out despairingly
over the trackless sea, and appealingly up at the
towering mountains which had been her
companions during prosperity and adversity, but no
answer came to her anxious questionings. Then
suddenly, one day, word was brought to her by an
old woman of her clan that two French frigates
had landed in the harbor of Tahiti. She knew
this meant the end, unless Queen Pomare could
be persuaded to return to Tahiti and accept the
offer of the French. The old crone who had
brought her the news said to her: &quot;Don't you
know that you are the first in the Island, and
that it remains in your hands to save all this
and your land?&quot; Then Ariitaimai hesitated no
longer, but hastened to the governor and told
him what she had heard. He replied: &quot;You have
heard the truth. The colonel commanding the
troops has heard of so many instances of insult
given to the French that we have decided at last
to go out and finish up the affair.&quot; This brusque
answer aroused in Ariitaimai all the stored-up
energy of years. She became immediately the
diplomatic representative of her people, and
begged the governor to give her a few days that
she might see the chiefs and make at least an
effort to avert the terrible havoc to lives and
property which this would cause. Ariitaimai was
well known to the governor, and although
evidently amused that a young woman should take
upon herself this difficult task, readily consented.
Like two generals they sat down and talked over
all the terms of the peace; the governor agreeing
to restore Pomare to her throne if she would
return immediately, and to leave the chiefs in
possession of their estates and control each of
his own chiefery, all to be under the protection
of the French flag. This, he said, they were
willing to do, although the Queen had broken her
written agreement with them, and by deserting
her country and throne had absolved them from
all obligations to her. Before the conclusion of
the interview Ariitaimai had won the respect and
admiration of the governor, and from that time
on they worked together to bring about a
peaceable settlement of the long and disastrous war.
The journey which she was obliged to make in
order to meet the chiefs in council was a long
one, and while she was making her preparations
the governor's own aid-de-camp arrived ready
to accompany her, bringing the governor's
horses and all necessary passports. She says in
her memoirs: &quot;I knew that my influence with
the natives would be sufficient to save us from
any trouble with them.&quot; Arrived at last at the
principal native fort where the chiefs were
assembled, her first act showed her the accomplished
diplomat. She sent a trusty messenger for
Nuutere, the one whose influence against peace
she most feared, and who with the other chief,
Teaatoro, practically controlled the situation.
When he came out to see her she took him by
the hand and said: &quot;My object in coming here
is to bring peace, and I have counted on you
for the sake of old friendship to be my speaker
in this trying instance.&quot; She quaintly adds:
&quot;He was very much perplexed at this,&quot; evidently
not understanding why she could not speak for
herself as she had often done before. But to
her surprise Ariitaimai found the old chief very
much broken in spirit and quite ready to listen
to her arguments for peace, and she soon had
his promise to speak for the acceptance of the
governor's proposition. Human nature is very
much the same the world over, whether encased
in a brown skin or white. Nuutere called
Teaatoro to him, and, after a hasty consultation,
came over and whispered to Ariitaimai that
Teaatoro would be all right. This practically
settled the matter, but as in all political
assemblies the usual formalities must be gone through
with and Nuutere called upon each one of the
chiefs for his opinion. The speakers all teemed
with love and admiration for my heroine and
I can not refrain from making some quotations.
Nuutere, after stating the object of the meeting,
called upon Teaatoro to make the first speech.
He said: &quot;We are all as one person in this
meeting, and we have suffered together as
brothers. We have heard what the object of
this lone woman's visit amongst us is, solely
for our good and that of our children. What can
we say to this? We can only return her one
answer, which is to thank her for the trouble
and danger she has taken upon herself, for
the peace she has brought, and she must return
to the French commander with this our answer.
We have been five months on the point of
starvation. We lost a great many of our
men at Tamavao. The best of our blood was
spilled at Mahaena. At Piha-e-atata, our
young men were slain. Our Queen left us in
the midst of our troubles without the least
sorrow for us. We have heard no more of the help
which was promised us by Great Britain.&quot;
Another chief rose and said: &quot;Ariitaimai, you have
flown amongst us, as it were, like the two birds
of Ruataa and Teena. You have brought the
cooling medicine of vainu into the hearts of the
chiefs. Our hearts yearn for you and we can
not in words thank you; you have brought us
the best of all goods, which is peace. You have
done this when you thought we were in great
trouble, and ran the risk of losing our lives and
property. Your people will prove to you in the
future that your visit will always remain in their
memory.&quot; The old chief of her own district
turned toward Ariitaimai and said only: &quot;As
you are my head, my eyes, my hands and my
feet, what more can I say? What you have
decided we accept and will carry out.&quot; One
dissenting voice only was heard, a young chief
who had but lately come into his possessions and
was anxious to distinguish himself as a warrior.
He called out in a loud voice: &quot;Why have you
decided upon this peace so soon? Tahiti is not
broken asunder. We could play with the French
until we could get aid of Great Britain, who has
formally promised to help us through in this
war. I think you have all done wrong.&quot; But
the young man had his lesson to learn and it was
promptly taught him by Ariitaimai's spokesman.
The spirit of young America is not appreciated
in Tahiti, where reverence for age and worship
of the ancestors is a vital part of the native pagan
religion. Nuutere turned on the young man
and asked: &quot;Where were you, that consider
yourself such a fighting man, in the fights which
have already happened? I have never perceived
you ahead of the others. You do not excel the
youngest of our men in all of these battles.
What are you known as in the annals of the
country which allows you to get up and speak
when your chiefs have already given the word?&quot;
Ariitaimai set out immediately on her return
trip, this time escorted by ten of the chiefs.
Although they made all possible haste the time
had already expired before they reached the
governor's headquarters, and preparations were
being made to attack one of the native forts, the
officers having concluded that her errand had
been a failure. The governor, seeing her at a
distance, rode out to meet her and helped her
from her horse. He asked her anxiously in
Tahitian, &quot;Is it peace?&quot; and she replied that it
was peace and that everything was all right with
the chiefs. He held her hand as he said with
great feeling: &quot;The Tahitians should never
forget you; but your work is not finished. You
must now go to Raiatea and bring us back the
Queen.&quot; So Ariitaimai started on her second
and more difficult errand. At first Queen Pomare
refused to receive her, sending word that she
was told that she had gone over to the French;
but later she granted her an interview in which
she cried very much, upbraiding her friend for
the stand she had taken, and accusing her of
betraying her interests to the French.</p>
<p>The Queen then sent for the chiefs of her
own family with whom she had taken refuge,
and, after a prolonged conference, they advised
her not to return. She said to Ariitaimai: &quot;I
trust to the word of Great Britain, who has
promised us to send ships and men to fight our
cause and to keep us an independent state, and
I will not return and be under the French.&quot; So
after repeated pleading poor Ariitaimai was
obliged to return to the governor with Pomare's
answer. He was much disappointed but said as
the chiefs of Tahiti had agreed to peace and as
he had nothing to do with the chiefs of Raiatea
they must decide on another monarch, and
offered to make Ariitaimai queen of Tahiti in
Pomare's place. But this the faithful friend
would not listen to, and begged the governor to
allow her again to see Pomare, as she believed
that when she had had time to think the matter
over she would change her mind. To this the
governor very reluctantly consented, as he was
entirely out of patience with Pomare, and would
much have preferred to make Ariitaimai queen,
which could have been done with great
propriety, as she was at that time the head chiefess
of the island. After a stormy trip she arrived
again at Raiatea and this time was fortunate
enough to find her friend Aimata alone, the
chiefs having gone to an assembly to consult
over the affairs of their own island. This time
our faithful ambassadress did not hasten her
visit. She renewed and strengthened the ties
of friendship which had bound them together
since their early girlhood, and she records in
her memoirs that they had a beautiful visit
together before any mention was made of the
real object of her coming. The charming way
in which she speaks in her memoirs of Pomare's
flight shows the tenderness of her affection
for her friend. She says, calling her by her
girlhood name: &quot;The unfortunate Aimata had
troubles of every sort, domestic, political,
private and public, until at last the missionaries
English and French, fought so violently for
control of her and the island that she was fairly
driven away.&quot; With all her acuteness and
learning in other matters, she seems to have had no
realization of the true character of the woman she
so beautifully idealized. She still saw in the Queen
the qualities she loved in the young girl, and
her affection blinded her to the defects in her
friend's character which entirely unfitted her for
the position she occupied. Events do not move
as rapidly in Tahiti as in America, and our young
diplomat, having the governor's promise to await
her return, took her own time. She remained
with the Queen two months and had the
satisfaction of returning home with her promise to
sail for Tahiti as soon as her favorite schooner
Ana could be made ready. But, before sailing,
another idea took possession of the unreasonable
woman and she sent word to the Tahitian chiefs
that as the English had brought her to Raiatea
she would return only in an English ship, and
demanded that one be sent to fetch her.</p>
<p>This unexpected and preposterous demand
plunged poor Ariitaimai into the deepest grief.
For the first time a note of complaint of her
friend appears in her memoirs. The French
governor laughed at the demands of Pomare and
again offered the throne to Ariitaimai, and
argued long to prove to her that it was her duty
to accept it. Where in history is the woman who
would not now have felt that she had exhausted
all the demands of friendship, who would not
by this time have been tempted by the dazzling
prospect of a throne, upheld by a powerful
governor who had become her devoted friend and
admirer, to be surrounded by chiefs who had
already accepted her leadership, and who, for
years, had held her position among them as
chief ess as a sacred trust? But no ambitious
dreams disturbed the clear judgment of this
simple-minded woman. She had set herself a
task and her only ambition was to accomplish it.
Not for one moment did the loyal woman waver
in her devotion to her friend. She refused
absolutely to entertain a thought of the queenship,
and retired to her country home almost in
despair. She says very simply in her memoirs:
&quot;We then remained at home in great trouble
and did not know what was to be done next.
The governor on several occasions offered to
make me the sovereign of the island in place of
Pomare, which, however, I could not entertain.&quot;
It is in this simple and childlike manner she
describes all the events in this perplexing
situation. Not by one word does she anywhere
intimate that she is doing anything extraordinary
or praiseworthy or more than her simple duty.</p>
<p>She was not allowed to remain long inactive.
Word came to her that the governor and chiefs
were getting very restless and impatient at the
unsettled state of the island politics and had
decided not to negotiate further with the Pomares;
and, moreover, that a document to this effect had
been already drawn up and practically agreed
upon. This roused her again to see the
governor; and this time Fate put a powerful weapon
in her hands. Just as she was leaving her home
an old native preacher came along and secretly
gave her a letter from her beloved Aimata. She
wrote that she was sorry that she had not come
back when she promised, that she was much
distressed at the news from Tahiti, that she was
an unhappy woman and, if not too late, she would
surely come back if her faithful friend would
come for her. Happy Ariitaimai fairly flew to
the governor. What after all if it should be too
late! She had never gone to the governor with
so much fear and trepidation, and her fears were
in no way lessened by his reception of her request
that she be allowed to go once more to Raiatea
and make a last effort to bring back the Queen.
This request for the first time irritated the
governor toward her. He said: &quot;Have you not done
enough for the Pomares that you should
continue to go down to fetch them?&quot; and he showed
her the document which she had heard of but
which was much worse than she supposed, as it
proposed to break up the act of protectorate
that had been already made and distinctly stated
that as Ariitalmai had refused to be made queen
he would make the island a French colony at
once. But with that precious letter in her bosom
she would not be thwarted in her purpose, and
did not leave the governor until she had received
his very grudging permission to see Pomare and,
if she consented to return, to take her to Moorea
and let him know. With this she was obliged
to be contented. More she could not accomplish
without divulging the secret of her letter, and
this, she argued, would be disloyal to her friend;
for was it not a secret letter sent to her at great
risk? No, she would accomplish her purpose
without humiliating her Queen. Pomare should
return at the request of the governor without
losing aught of her queenly dignity.</p>
<p>And now this little drama draws rapidly to a
close. Ariitaimai made her third trip to Raiatea
and accompanied Pomare to Moorea, and sent
word to the governor that he would find them
there. Obedient to this gently expressed
command of his ambassadress, the governor very
courteously went to Moorea in person to receive
the Queen and bring her back to her home and
throne. In the same dispassionate style
Ariitaimai tells of the homeward journey: &quot;As we all
went on board a salute was fired. We sailed
around the island, flying the protectorate flag at
the fore, to inform the people of these islands
that their Queen had returned. We then
continued our route for Papeete and on arriving
there the forts from the shore saluted the flag.&quot;
But O! the irony of Fate! As they entered the
harbor what a sight met the eyes of the poor
Queen! Both British and American ships were
anchored there, having come at last in answer
to her appeals, but only in time to see her placed
on her throne by the grace of the hated French,
But peace had been bought too dearly to be
broken now even by this vacillating queen, and
the British and American officers, seeing the
situation, had the good sense to assist in the
general festivities celebrating the long-looked-for
peace. The memoirs conclude with this simple
statement: &quot;The Queen remained several hours
on board the steamer as the governor wished the
natives to see that the Queen had really come
back. There were soldiers in line on shore to
receive us and we were conducted to the
governor's house. The peace of the island was then
decided upon. On arriving at the governor's
house we found all the commanders of the troops
and vessels there and before them I was thanked
by Governor Bruat for what I had done for my
country.&quot;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
